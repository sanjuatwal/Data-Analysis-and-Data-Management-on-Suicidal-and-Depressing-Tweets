###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say &amp;quot;PM me anytime&amp;quot; in a casual social context.  &lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it&amp;#39;s much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It&amp;#39;s partly about availability, but it&amp;#39;s mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it&amp;#39;s much harder for others, including the &lt;a href=""/r/depression""&gt;/r/depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""/r/SuicideWatch""&gt;/r/SuicideWatch&lt;/a&gt; moderators to help&lt;/strong&gt;.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can&amp;#39;t see or police PMs.)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our observation over many years, the people who say &amp;quot;PM me&amp;quot; the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. &lt;strong&gt;There&amp;#39;s no reason why someone who&amp;#39;s truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny&lt;/strong&gt;.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. &lt;strong&gt;If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they&amp;#39;ve primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.&lt;/strong&gt; This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone&amp;#39;s in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don&amp;#39;t recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

maximus came home almost four years ago, after enduring years of abuse. he was a 90 pound hunk of love who thought he weighed about 5 pounds. most handsome boy youve ever seen, a pitbull with the biggest block head that i love more than anything. he always had to be by my side, and i always had to be by his. i would lay on the floor with him any chance i had, and he would always angle his head down and just collapse his body into my lap. my boy loved to get dressed up- a bandana around his neck always made him sit up a little taller, and walk a little prouder. 

he got a rough start, having been used as a bait dog for the first half of his life. his body was permanently marked with scars from where evil scum had cut him repeatedly. when we found each other at the shelter, he had been there for 9 months and been adopted out and taken back quite a few times. ill never be able to wrap my mind around the fact no one else kept him, but im so thankful they didnt and that he waited for my family. he was missing almost all his teeth from chewing rocks, and was blind in his left eye. he has seen and experienced the worst humankind has to offer yet still had more love for us than you could ever imagine. he was my big, goofy, happy happy guy. the biggest regret i have is that i didnt get to him sooner than i did. 

Maximus didnt want to eat anything the past few days, and was more sluggish than usual. my mom took him to the vet yesterday just to make sure nothing was actually wrong, and they told us his red blood count was low and he needed a blood transfusion. it was serious but no reason he wont recover from it. we took him from there to emergency vet, where they ran tests and did scans. the vet said he has never seen anything like what was shown on those scans, that my sweet maximus was a very very sick little boy. the inside of his spleen was supposed to look like peanut butter, but instead it looked like chunky jelly with chunks and lumps he could not identify. his body had developed multiple tumors, which were cancerous. he had gone into “tumor lysis crisis” meaning that a large amount of the cancer cells that were comtained in these tumors died, and released their cancerous contents into his blood. they were killing his red blood cells and destroying the ability to regenerate any at all. his stomach had bloated 3x its normal size, even though it was just later in the day and yesterday morning it had looked fine. 

the vet discouraged us from treatment because he didnt see any possible way maximus could recover- putting him on treatment would only prolong his suffering and ensure he passed painfully. which is cruelly ironic, as putting him on treatment would keep my suffering at bay. but i have to do right by my boy. he’s been through too much and endured more than i can imagine, he was brought into this world in pain and i promised him when i brought him home he would leave it in love. i had to keep that promise. i love him more than it seems like my heart can handle, and making the right decision for him is the absolute utterly wrong decision for me. 

we got the vet this morning and despite not moving except to lift his head the past few days, he trotted off away from the building. i believe in the deepest place of my heart he knew what we were there for, and he was scared. he wouldnt let me turn him around back toward it, and the most he would take was two steps toward the building and then sit back down. i sat down with him and just sobbed. the thought of not having that big brown baby rips my heart into shreds and pierces my soul. 

we finally got him inside after i just sat with him and talked to him for about 15 minutes. ive never wanted to simply wait in a waiting room longer, but they called us right back. i prayed that the doctor was tied up and would take a while before she got back there, but no sooner did i finish thinking that she came in. i felt myself detach from my body at that point. i cant remember anything she said, but i know from the time she came in the room to the time she left the room was only about five minutes. 

my babys body was so tired, it had been fighting so hard for so long. he was gone before the injection to stop his heart was even finished. 

my world and heart suddenly felt so... empty. 
i was wailing in the vets office, the pain is so deep. the doctor told me our grief is only a reflection of our love, and i believe that 100%. i genuinely dont think i could love my boy even an OUNCE more because my little heart would give out. 

im back home now, my other dogs don’t understand why their brother isnt here. i never ever expected my maximus to be the first to go. i have two other senior dogs, and maximus is the youngest. i felt so sure i had at least 3-4 more years with him, and i feel so robbed. i wasnt remotely prepared, i had zero clue this was coming. the one comfort i have is i dont feel remorse over the amount of time i spent with him. i dont feel like i wish i wouldve sat with him and pet him more because that dog was at my side constantly. any spare second i have im laying with him. anywhere i go, hes the one that gets up in the car and rides with me. he loves a car ride. i always surprise him with a mcdouble, and the excitement he shows never ever ever gets old. im not prepared for all of that to be a fond memory. im scared, because i know in time ill forget how it felt to pet that big block head and i dont ever want to. i tried to memorize everything i could about the way he feels, so i hope its a long time before that happens. but for right now all i can think about is how it felt holding him and petting him and how it felt. 

ive been in a bad depressive state the past few weeks, and i dont know how im ever going to feel okay again. maximus is my comfort, i seek him out when im sad because of the comfort he brings, and now he’s not here to comfort me when i need it the most. 

please be kind to me, im not in a good place right now.

Not until it was too late.

Fuck up one: Mental health. Just... fuck, man, I don’t even know how to fix this one. I’m just a damn mess. Everything overwhelms me, everything scares me, and I basically let fear win. I was bullied a lot in school, and had few friends, but I barely passed my GCSE’s anyways, I got mostly C’s. But then my friends all moved on and moved away, and I failed A-Levels because of anxiety. I was too stupid to understand what I was doing, too afraid to ask my teachers what to do, and too afraid to even make friends that could help me out. It got to the point where I was taking more and more sick days until I just stopped turning up, because the fear and the hopelessness won out. I gave up. And then I never did anything else. The longer I sat at home being afraid, the worse it got, and not I don’t even know **how** to be a regular person. How to look, act, talk... I just panic. I give up before I try.

Fuck up two: I believed love was going to save me. I had a boyfriend, from the age of 13 to 24, and I had convinced myself, and he had convinced me, that he was going to make it okay. He was normal, so he got a job, and started helping me with small goals, but he also enabled me and I let him. He promised we’d get a place together and someday get married, and I could either look after the home, or find a job when I was ready. It’s pathetic, but it was easy and not scary, so I believed it. I let him spoil me, got used to him spoiling me, and believed one day it would just “work out”. That we’d move in together and I’d gradually stop being scared, that doctors would one day fix me, but I had time because my boyfriend/eventual husband would help. But then at 24 he left me, and I realised I’d put every single egg in one basket. I had no savings, no social life, and no happiness. He was my everything. And I broke **hard** when he left.

Fuck up three: I gave up, and I let my family enable and coddle me, as I did with my ex. This is fucking shameful to admit... But I’m 27 now and I live with my mum. I have never moved out, because I planned to live with my ex, and he always promised we would “one day”. (He moved out of his parents house a year after we split.) I have never gone to college or university, because I don’t know what I have the skills to do. I have never had a job, because although it was because of my own failings, my mental health is so shit now that I go to interviews and burst into tears out of fear. My brain just shuts off. I don’t know how to care for myself, because my mum does everything herself, both because it’s easier than teaching me and doesn’t want another person getting in the way, and because she loves me and wants to make it easier for me. I know she has my best interest in heart, but it just makes me hate myself more because I’m useless. I’m a scared child in an adults body and I hate myself for it.

I know I have to change. I know I want to change. But finding a start point is hard. Fighting the bad days is hard. Fighting the urge to give up on everything, even life, is hard. The shame makes it harder, but I know I need, deserve, the shame, in order to force me to change. 

I keep hoping getting on the right meds will help... But fighting the doctors to change or even up my meds is like wrestling a bear, and they never actually do anything. The anxiety, the overthinking, the hopelessness, it’s all still there. I worry that my brain is permenantly broken.

Maybe all I can do is change my life. But change costs money, and willpower, and I don’t have much of either.

All I know is, I’m exactly the worst kind of person. The kind of person that is a waste of resources and money and time. I’m sorry. I want to be better. I will try to be better. But I wish there was a guidebook for this.

&lt;p&gt;I know I have to change. I know I want to change. But finding a start point is hard. Fighting the bad days is hard. Fighting the urge to give up on everything, even life, is hard. The shame makes it harder, but I know I need, deserve, the shame, in order to force me to change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep hoping getting on the right meds will help... But fighting the doctors to change or even up my meds is like wrestling a bear, and they never actually do anything. The anxiety, the overthinking, the hopelessness, it’s all still there. I worry that my brain is permenantly broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe all I can do is change my life. But change costs money, and willpower, and I don’t have much of either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I know is, I’m exactly the worst kind of person. The kind of person that is a waste of resources and money and time. I’m sorry. I want to be better. I will try to be better. But I wish there was a guidebook for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for listening.&lt;/p&gt;

Right now I'm a cleaner and work nights so I don't have to interact with anyone but I hate the job.

The thing while I'm there all I want to do is go home so I put in minimum effort and do it as quick as I can.

Ive never been in a relationship. I can't talk to anyone without getting extreme bouts of anxiety. I don't know why anyone would go out with me I've barely even got a personality and my life is such a mess it's a joke. 

I haven't made any new friend since highschool. The only  way I keep in contact with my old friends is when we used to play games together but I've been to depressed to do that in ages it just feels like effort. Effort to play and effort to talk.

I've got very little contact with my family. It's not even like we're on bad terms or anything we just don't talk. I've never got anything new to share about my life anyway so I don't even know what to talk about. 

I go weeks with out washing and my laundry never gets ironed or folded. I don't really eat out that much and try to eat healthy. I only drink water and go for walks whenever I've got the energy but that isn't that often. 

I try and put myself out there and find new hobbies all the time but nothing ever sticks. I force myself to go on hikes or to the beach or out to a bar at least once a week but I never enjoy myself.

It takes me hours to get out of bed in the morning. I sleep way too much and daydream an unhealthy amount. No matter what I do I always feel fatigued.

I don't even have a reason to be depressed. It's not like I've gone through some kind of trauma or been through a bad breakup. This is just who I am. It's who I've been for the last 5 years with no end in sight. I go to a psychologist I've been on various antidepressants for years but It never gets better.

I don't really want to die. I want like anything to he able to enjoy life. But I can't keep living like this where everything i do is an uphill battle. Where I've got to put in enormous amounts of effort just to do things that come naturally to most people and then not even be happy after putting in all the effort.


I try to improve but everytime anxiety, depression, procrastination or fatigue is always there to pull me back down.

I&amp;#39;ve dealing with depression since I was a teenager. But this time was different. It got to the point where I had visit the doctors, and I was prescribed sertraline. I also had to tell my family, friends and employer. As I was no longer capable of hiding it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a year later and in theory I&amp;#39;am better. I&amp;#39;am not on anti-depressants anymore. As far as my family and friends are concerned I&amp;#39;am back to normal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;am not as bad as I was. but I still don&amp;#39;t feel right. I don&amp;#39;t understand why this happened to me. I don&amp;#39;t know what causes my depression. Whenever I think about it I feel terrible and I breakdown into tears. &lt;/p&gt;

Hope you are all doing good. 

I’m a 22F who’s been struggling since I was 13 with depression and Anxiety. 
I had a very very traumatic childhood which stuffed me up for years, think about all the trauma you see on tv, I’ve been through most of it. I was raised by my drug addict mum and had a few different men raise me with mum but no one ever stayed so it was more my single mum.

I got depression when I was 13 and just started high school. It came out of no where and from then on, I was fucked. 
I was bullied and never could keep friends (I still don’t have any friends now, I don’t know why I can’t keep them).
I left school in grade 9 and never finished schooling because of depression. Since then I’ve practically been bed/ house ridden. 

I’ve been to psychologists and I’ve talked about my childhood. That is all behind me now, I don’t brood on it nor do I have PTSD anymore from it. 

So, i struggle to be happy, I want to be happy but I can’t seem to be. I’ve tried medication from the doctor but it never has worked on me.
I have a loving partner and im happy IN the relationship however that’s the only thing im happy about and outside that there is no happiness with life. 

I don’t have a job, I don’t have any friend (can’t keep them), I don’t have any hobbies and im overall just miserable.
Weekends I don’t do anything, holidays I don’t do anything, it’s just bleak. And when I do try to do something fun, it don’t enjoy it. 

I just want to be happy and have a full, happy life but for some reason my head is not letting me.

I just want support from people who are similar to me and maybe share some helpful tips.

I've always struggled with some form of depression or hopeless thinking throughout my life but I bounce back. I have had a bit of a rough life growing up as a kid making me not so close with my family. I also moved out of state as an adult and don't have many friends in this state. I'm in my 30s and for the past couple years I feel more and more hopeless.

Several years ago I was dating someone and I thought it was serious, we lived together for nearly two years. I made a career change -- only after thoroughly discussing it with my partner at the time and planning our future based on this -- my partner was also getting a promotion. Right when the last bit of my savings had been spent, my partner left me and I had to find a new place to live. It was frustrating -- not because of leaving me but because she was never straight forward and honest, was always too polished, it was like talking to a politician or tech support. It made me feel like I wasn't even worth being honest to. A few months later she finally admitted to having feelings for a co-worker that she never admitted to before this, but she said later she didn't pursue it.

I was angry for a long time after this as my heart was broken over someone I loved and my financial situation crumbled. I went home for the holidays and tried for the first time to console to family members who told me who used it as an opportunity to punch down on me. I vowed to not see them again.

I ended up speaking to this ex again about half a year later, constantly walking on egg shells letting her know if she ever wanted to stop talking we could. She became more and more distant but wouldn't be straight forward. I am fortunate enough to have dated other people to know not everyone is this manipulative. We got in an argument and she said she wanted to go on a break from talking I said ""if you don't want to talk ever again just say it"" and she wouldn't say it, just ""she wanted to go on a break from talking and I can't explain why but it isn't out of anger"". Of course she blocked me and that was like a year ago. I just only ever wanted honesty but never got it once from her. I've come to accept that it is unlikely there was any love from this person.

&amp;#x200B;

This was all during a time when my housemate destroyed my home, she had a mental breakdown and hadn't paid rent for 5 months. I was trying to get off the lease. Unfortunately I had paid rent that whole time and have to deal with this hit to my credit when I refused to resign the lease, therefore causing us to be evicted but I was unwilling to keep living with a person who refused to pay rent. She threatened my landlord's life and constantly blew up my phone and cursed at me (I was staying somewhere else, not dealing with her, still paying rent in a place I didn't live).

&amp;#x200B;

I now live in destitute a year later -- two since breaking up. An old friend asked to video chat for a short bit and said I looked like the life had been sucked from me, looked at me in horror.

&amp;#x200B;

I have had tooth pain that I ignore. I used to be a healthy vegetarian, now nearly all my meals are fast food. I used to not smoke but now I am a smoker. I have taken up habits that accelerate my life. I am in therapy right now, and have been for two years. I just wish this one person could've ever been honest to me, just said they hated me or they in fact never did want to talk to me again. I wish the optimism wasn't stripped from my bones. I look back on my life and feel as if I am approaching the ""bad ending"". I have no support network anymore, the one friend I video chatted was a girl I used to date who was telling me about the new guy she is dating. I started to cry after, from looking at her and seeing me in the video, to seeing how far I've fallen compared to everyone. I only see life as a thing to be grinded away. I'm in my thirties and am as poor as I've ever been, I've only ever been dumped and I feel the things I hoped to have at this point -- friends, a lover, possibly thinking about a family, a permanent home -- I don't have and doubt I will ever have.

Let’s call them friend A and B. 

In December 2020 I started getting really depressed due to a highly stressful job, the fact that for the first time ever I’d be spending Christmas alone (covid lockdowns, family far away) and finding out that a close family member has cancer. 

For New Years I went to friend A’s house and she asked me about my relative and the cancer treatment, but I kept getting interrupted while other people in the background were making jokes and my friend wasn’t really listening. She was like, Oh sorry you were saying, go on…I was feeling highly sensitive and about to cry but she wasn’t listening to what I had to say. I felt shut down but I wasn’t gonna let this be a reason for getting mad at her.  

Now friend B, I’ve known most of my life, almost 20 years. We wished each other happy New Years and I asked her when she’s free to FaceTime. Again, I was a wreck, just spent Christmas alone, had intrusive thoughts about my relative. I really needed to talk to her. I get that Christmas time is busy but she got back to me around Jan 13 “we can FaceTime tomorrow”

That was 2 weeks later and in those 2 weeks my mental health declined even more. At this point, I didn’t even feel like texting her back right away. I texted her a few days later and admitted that I’m in a bad headspace and I’ll FaceTime her in a few days. But I didn’t. 

My mental health kept getting worse, I wasn’t taking care of myself, skipped showers, I was binging on unhealthy foods, not exercising, had insomnia, headaches, neglected to take care of things around the house. And I couldn’t stop crying. 

I’d cry soon after waking up, while driving to work, I’d cry on my lunch breaks, and when I got home. I started developing intrusive thoughts, thinking what is the point of it all, how I hate the way my life turned out, etc.

Things got REALLY bad. Friend A and B texted me on my birthday (end of Feb) and it took me days to even read the messages, and text back. Everything, even the smallest tasks took so much effort. 
Literally on my birthday, I kept getting messages from people and I wanted to throw my phone out the window. It wasn’t a happy birthday. I was at work and on my lunch break, went for a drive to get a coffee and again started bawling my eyes out. 

I thanked them for the wishes and didn’t say anything else. Now fast forward to mid March, it’s friend B’s birthday. I wished her a happy birthday but she never texted back.
Which I understand. My lack of communication could’ve been taken the wrong way as I never explained to them what I was truly going through. 

I think about my two friends all the time, and I wish I hadn’t fucked up our friendships. I want to reach out and apologize but I don’t even know where to start. We’re now in July…I was basically a ghost for 6 months. 

I never suffered from such deep depression in my whole life, it was so bad that even the smallest tasks took a lot of effort. I become so isolated, desperately tried to work on myself. But it takes time. You can’t get better over night. Only now i am starting to feel like myself again, not 100% back to normal yet but getting there.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I need (F 30) some advice on how I can reach out to my friends after being distant for a few months.

i couldnt even get him back...i couldnt even do that right

i thought maybe if i spoke to him, everything would go back to how it was before, my other friend did that and it went extremely well for her...why couldnt it go well for me too?

i cant find a boyfriend, i cant meet people, i cant even bring back people from the past that actually understood me, im alone

i tried so hard and still...im alone

i've always wanted someone to help me, since i was young, i always wanted someone to appear already and save me

First of all I wan't you to know that if reading about people recovering is something that puts pressure on you or triggers you in any way better stop reading. I know that back when I was severely depressed I didn't want to hear from people that got healthy again because it made me feel like a failure because I couldn't seem to get there. It's totally fine if you ignore my post. 

I am just looking for advice from people that have overcome depression to hopefully find out that I am not alone with this. I got diagnosed with severe depression back in January 2018 after already suffering for 3 months without knowing what was up. I got on meds and into therapy, went through many ups and downs and finally went back to university in June 2019. Then in January 2020 I finally felt like I was completely my old self again, stopped taking my meds and going to therapy.

The pandemic hit and of course it was hard for me to be back at home with myself after I was finally back out living life after almost two years. But I still think I managed it quite well. Down days were only normal down days (once you've had depression you really get the difference between being down like a normal person and being down like a depressed one) and they passed usually within half a week or so.  

But now to the reason of my post: they don't seem to pass lately. It's been over a month of me not feeling good. In the sense of: I get ""sick"" a lot (not sure if you know what I mean...it's actually being physically sick but knowing that it's rooted in you not wanting to get out of bed - if that makes sense?) I don't feel like meeting my friends and often cancel, saying I have to study - even tough I don't really plan on studying anyway. I don't seem to see the fun in things I normally like and if I do it fades quickly. I also don't sleep well - it's been a long time since I slept through a night. And of course the classic: I often feel useless and sad, even though I know that I have many people in my life that love me. 

So I know many of these things can be symptoms of depression. I also know that many of these feelings are also common in people who are not depressed. My problem is that I know how I was when I was depressed and it's not that bad now. So I don't think I am depressed again but it still worries me. I am just scared that it will come back - actually really scared. Because (I don't think I have to tell any of you) it's hell to be depressed. 

Has anyone else experienced this? I know statistically it's not likely that I will have another episode. Or does anyone have any advice for me? 

I am sorry if my post is confusing, I just wanted to vent somewhere because it is really hard to explain any of this to people that have never been depressed  and also I don't want my family and friends to worry as long as it's not that bad...","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys.&lt;/p&gt;

September 2017:  
Body dysmorphia leads me to believe I have gynecomastia. Plastic surgery research occupies most of my time. Turns out to be basically negligible and a case that goes away if I lose weight (learned this much later on).

December 2017:  
After 6 scheduled (and cancelled) surgery dates with plastic surgeons to remove the gynecomastia, my parents recommend that I see our doctor and talk about depression. I oblige.

January 2018:  
After my first visit with the doctor, I start taking Zoloft 25mg 1x/day.

March 2018:  
I up the dosage to 50mg/day. Start complaining to doctor about ""emotional numbness"" and taper back down to 25mg 2x/day.

April 2018:  
I'm at a bar and get cold clocked (to this day I still do not know who hit me). Clean mandibular fracture and broken in two places. Wired shut for 4 weeks after that.

August 2018:  
Decide I'm good and that I don't need Zoloft anymore (was also very overweight). Go off the drug and two weeks later, I total my '01 BMW e46 M3 that I bought a year prior after running a stop light I didn't see. T-boned a taxi.

September 2018:  
Researching that Zoloft weakens bone density and increases risk of fractures by up to 75%. Thought of ""if you weren't on Zoloft, your jaw wouldn't have broken"" starts to grow in my head. call my mom on my birthday, mention suicide for the first time. She says I ""can't leave this earth"" in tears.

October 2018:  
Meet a new girl, we become boyfriend and girlfriend.

April 2019:  
I buy a penis enlargement device ""just because"" to see if I can get any bigger for my gf at the time. And mind you, I was not insecure about my size to begin with, I just wanted to see if it could get bigger. I ended up suffering an injury from doing too much, too fast that left my penis in a ""hard flaccid"" state sometimes, and actually lost a bit of length and girth because of it. This leads to a lot of anxiety and depression that I still experience to this day.

May 2019:  
Depressed, I decide to start Zoloft again. 25mg 1x/day.

September 2019:  
I go off of Zoloft again. Girlfriend and I break up.

October 2019 - January 2021:  
Working full-time, met another girl around Feb 2020 that I dated up until recently. Things we just OK. Covid didn't make things any easier, but whatever.

February 2021:  
I approach a urologist about the potential of Zoloft ruining my sex drive, and that's the reason I can't perform like I used to. I start doing research and come across Wellbutrin. I start taking Wellbutrin 100mg SR 1x/day.

March 2021:  
I go off of Wellbutrin.

\*\*\*Wellbutrin 100mg/1x per day continues for month-long streaks coupled with about a month off. This cycle repeats itself for about 3 months up until the middle of this past June.

\- - - - - - - - - - -

End of June 2021:  
I come across a bunch of photos of myself a year or two prior to the gynecomastia/Zoloft phase. Look myself and love what I see. My face looked different. I remember my penis looking and functioning the way it used to.

July 4, 2021 (today):

I wake up, depressed again. Not high this time, but I start reading about people on psychiatric medications and how it can permanently mess them up. I start thinking about everything, from how my dick is fucked up, to how my face looks different from a jaw fracture I suffered because I chose to take antidepressants (and how the SSRIs probably weakened my bone density), how I pissed away good relationships with good women. Everything.

I go back upstairs and take my Dad's ruger out again. I look at it. This time I cry a little bit. I start to realize I'm unstable and the only thing holding me back is that I really don't know how to operate a ruger, and the magazines are out (though there are bullets in the magazines). I frighten myself again, and put it back in the case. I cry to God a bit here and say ""I'm really having a tough time here man. I don't know what to do.""

10:24am July 4, 2021: I hit ""post"" here on Reddit, then grab my keys and head into town for my habitual coffee. Feeling a bit better after getting this off my chest.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Starting my senior year of college) - posted in &lt;a href=""/r/suicidewatch""&gt;r/suicidewatch&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;September 2017:&lt;br/&gt;
Body dysmorphia leads me to believe I have gynecomastia. Plastic surgery research occupies most of my time. Turns out to be basically negligible and a case that goes away if I lose weight (learned this much later on).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;December 2017:&lt;br/&gt;
After 6 scheduled (and cancelled) surgery dates with plastic surgeons to remove the gynecomastia, my parents recommend that I see our doctor and talk about depression. I oblige.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;January 2018:&lt;br/&gt;
After my first visit with the doctor, I start taking Zoloft 25mg 1x/day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 2018:&lt;br/&gt;
I up the dosage to 50mg/day. Start complaining to doctor about &amp;quot;emotional numbness&amp;quot; and taper back down to 25mg 2x/day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 2018:&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;m at a bar and get cold clocked (to this day I still do not know who hit me). Clean mandibular fracture and broken in two places. Wired shut for 4 weeks after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;August 2018:&lt;br/&gt;
Decide I&amp;#39;m good and that I don&amp;#39;t need Zoloft anymore (was also very overweight). Go off the drug and two weeks later, I total my &amp;#39;01 BMW e46 M3 that I bought a year prior after running a stop light I didn&amp;#39;t see. T-boned a taxi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;September 2018:&lt;br/&gt;
Researching that Zoloft weakens bone density and increases risk of fractures by up to 75%. Thought of &amp;quot;if you weren&amp;#39;t on Zoloft, your jaw wouldn&amp;#39;t have broken&amp;quot; starts to grow in my head. call my mom on my birthday, mention suicide for the first time. She says I &amp;quot;can&amp;#39;t leave this earth&amp;quot; in tears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October 2018:&lt;br/&gt;
Meet a new girl, we become boyfriend and girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 2019:&lt;br/&gt;
I buy a penis enlargement device &amp;quot;just because&amp;quot; to see if I can get any bigger for my gf at the time. And mind you, I was not insecure about my size to begin with, I just wanted to see if it could get bigger. I ended up suffering an injury from doing too much, too fast that left my penis in a &amp;quot;hard flaccid&amp;quot; state sometimes, and actually lost a bit of length and girth because of it. This leads to a lot of anxiety and depression that I still experience to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 2019:&lt;br/&gt;
Depressed, I decide to start Zoloft again. 25mg 1x/day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;September 2019:&lt;br/&gt;
I go off of Zoloft again. Girlfriend and I break up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October 2019 - January 2021:&lt;br/&gt;
Working full-time, met another girl around Feb 2020 that I dated up until recently. Things we just OK. Covid didn&amp;#39;t make things any easier, but whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;February 2021:&lt;br/&gt;
I approach a urologist about the potential of Zoloft ruining my sex drive, and that&amp;#39;s the reason I can&amp;#39;t perform like I used to. I start doing research and come across Wellbutrin. I start taking Wellbutrin 100mg SR 1x/day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 2021:&lt;br/&gt;
I go off of Wellbutrin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;***Wellbutrin 100mg/1x per day continues for month-long streaks coupled with about a month off. This cycle repeats itself for about 3 months up until the middle of this past June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- - - - - - - - - - -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;End of June 2021:&lt;br/&gt;
I come across a bunch of photos of myself a year or two prior to the gynecomastia/Zoloft phase. Look myself and love what I see. My face looked different. I remember my penis looking and functioning the way it used to. I remember the way my teeth pressed together when I closed my mouth, and how my jaw didn&amp;#39;t click everytime I opened it or when I gave my girlfriend oral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**first scare here** (July 2, 2021):&lt;br/&gt;

I've got a therapist and I take medication. There is a lot more I could do around exercise, meditation etc.

Recently one of the few people I confided in, a colleague, decided she couldn't help me and didn't want to talk to me anymore. Ultimately everyone has one life and I can understand not wanting to fill that with depressed people, but it hurt a lot.

I just keep thinking about what my Uncle Doug did at 21. Take his own life. I don't think I'm that low, always said I don't believe in that. Somedays I feel so lonely I might as well not be here, but I'm just searching for belonging , someone to ask to me to be apart of their social gathering, even without my active searching to include myself and more seclude myself. My house has become a jail and I mainly go to sleep to escape any anxiety or other responsibility.  

I am 28 I think, I haven't celebrated a Birthday since I turned 18. I used to celebrate any and every holiday just to ""have fun"" or socialize but now it's just another day. Tomorrow is 4th of July. I would love to go to a lake , be with friends , float on a boat, fish ,laugh.

Laugh....it's been a while since I've sincerely laughed. My day goes wake up ,sit in bed scroll through social media, anxiety attack , see my husband have an uncomfortable emotional conversation , get dressed ,go to work , supervise ungrateful assholes ,get blamed for shit that is their fault and they can't handle emotionally , come home , mope in the fact I can't understand their logic for being assholes , blame myself for their being assholes and I am not a good enough leader for them , I am just a failure. Maybe cry, yell at my husband out of frustration , drink , eat like shit , go to sleep. I try to sleep at least 12 hours a day not to stress my husband out with what a burden I have become. I don't drink often, but I drink to escape the pain and the wrong reason. We both have alcoholism in our family and I feel this has contributed , among other thing, to our growing void in our marriage. I used to be bubbly, excited , giggly ,interested and motivated . I had so much going for myself in life ....now I just sulk and he put it correctly, we have been nothing but room mates for 6 years. 

Years, so much has happend , but I don't feel it is anything scarring enough for me to feel the way I feel. I studied epidemiology,  the gut brain connection and learned as much as I can about depression. I know what I can do to change it, but I choose to stay in my comfort zone and actually adore the sad empathy I get from my husband . Fucking pathetic.  I feel I have done nothing but bring him down. I am his anchor, but anchoring him from being happy now. 

I always say he deserves more than me, he and I used to work out together helped each other through college and have worked so hard to get to where we are. Then 2020. 2020 to most people say Corona , no life happend to us. He got injured at a job, had to quit, in a lawsuit which we will probably just waste of time and emotional energy, and we found out we can't have kids. We are having to move out of house as we can't afford it anymore. Our job sucks , just running our hope for happiness as they just drive us by production, replaceable by any means. He doesn't make what he used to, obviously. We haven't had a vacation in 2 years. 

The only thing I have to look forward to is selling this house and only cleaning an apartment. My dogs are entertaining and so loving. They are the only thing keeping me going lately. 

I sat on a lawn mower today thinking about how lonely I am. Although my husband is a great support and I could call family, I feel so alone. I have drifted so far from reality I am lost in my mind thinking that no one loves me, you are the reason you have no friends and you should just not wake up. It's a slow death, as I treat my body horribly , let my health be the last worry and I could care less. I just want to die of natural cause , that seems easier than giving the grief to my husband for suicide. He doesn't deserve that sadness. I love him so much, I just wish I could do anything. I can, I just choose not to. What happend to me, where did I lose myself. I have no plans for a future,  it's so blurry. 

I cried the other day to my aunt who has had far worse in life. She's been addicted , shot , jail ,single mom of 2 . I thought I was a bitch for moping about my small struggles. She was great and listened made sure I knew was worth a damn, but a bandaid falls off a aging reservoir quickly.  

These are my thoughts,  probably sound like a lot of batching. I really have no reason to butch, but I'm just so lonely.

I've never had any close friends, only a few friendships that fell apart when I realized that we didn't mesh well. 

I dropped out of school last November, because my increasing depression became too much for me to be able to continue studying.

Backstory: I've always struggles with depression and intrusive thought usually brought on by my father who is verbally abusive. He likes turning anything good to something negative. 

About me: 
I'm 20 this year and studying, I moved out of parent's place and was doing so good until Covid decided to make us poor so I had to go back to my parents. 

I've been diagnosed with depression and bipolar and am pretty familiar with when to know a manic episode is coming but my depression just hits me low.

All my colleagues always call me floaty because I'm happy and chill by nature. I never fight and always ignore drama and conflict. 

Here I get to the point:
My family was recently attacked by a neighbor and my dad defended us by stabbing him so he went to jail for bail. In that time my mom and I were alone and living peacefully without problems or drama but my dad was suffering in jail and we kept on working to fairly get him out so he was the victim. 

I was really worried about my dad coming home because he's always been very negative and makes anything a problem. He came back a nice, modest man who's grateful for everything. This however lasted only a week and once again everything in my home is cold and dark. We had a party and one of the guests accidentally packed his phone in when leaving. My dad went crazy accusing her of theft and screaming at us even though I got the phone back immediately. I had a panic attack due to all the screaming and anger.

Today nobody in the house is talking, everything is tense.
I'm just depressed and disappointed. I've been crying and nothing is happy anymore. The whole situation just completely through me of while I had been stable and happy till now.

We have an apartment by the beach where I want to flee since I can still have online class from there and my workplace allows me to travel since we serve the whole country so I can go there and still work and study without any additional moving or trouble Problem is that our country has some limits on traveling between states right now, however the apartment there is on my name and I could say I'm going home.

Should I stick it out at home or try to go? I know I cannot reject my father because his fragile yet his behavior is affecting my mental health.

&lt;p&gt;Should I stick it out at home or try to go? I know I cannot reject my father because his fragile yet his behavior is affecting my mental health. What would you do in this situation?&lt;/p&gt;

Why aren’t you talking?

Because I think he’s going to destroy himself, and anyone who lets him get too close. And I don’t want that to include me or Melanie.

Maybe he just needs some help.

GEORGIE

I did help him, as much as I safely could, but he just carried on anyway.

MARTIN

(overlapping) Yeah, he’ll do that.

GEORGIE

I realized if I kept trying it was gonna hurt me more than I was willing to accept.

MARTIN

Well, sometimes the helping people hurts.

GEORGIE

Sure, but that doesn’t mean everything painful helps.

Sometimes people have problems that will wreck you long before you can make a dent in them,and some people don’t want help, they just want other people suffering with them.

MARTIN

John doesn’t want that.

GEORGIE

He doesn’t know what he wants. And from the sound of things he’s run out of time to figure it out.

MARTIN

It’s easy to pass judgment from the outside.

GEORGIE

One more reason to stay on the outside and watch.

MELANIE

Right, right. Okay. I know… that is why I ruined my first four sessions and almost torpedoed the chance at a genuinely really good therapist, because I was so paranoid that she was going to turn out to be some – some thing trying to manipulate me. But no, she’s not full of spiders, or made of wax, or wearing the therapist’s skin or whatever, she’s just a well-trained professional who I am paying to help me.

ARCHIVIST

Okay. (sigh) It’s just… the Web can be subtle, you understand?

MELANIE

And? For all you know its plan is to paralyze you with indecision. Leaving you sitting here, terrified that everything you do is somehow all part of its grand plan. And who do you think that fear is gonna feed?

........ 

The Lonely is possibly the most insidious of the powers, I believe. Certainly it is the one that most delights and having you do its work for it, even the spiders seem to have a hard time matching it for sheer seductiveness. (hmph) Time to yourself. Self-care. Putting yourself first. Not being a burden on those you care about. Doesn’t even need to tell you any lies – just waits for the lies you tell yourself.

We’re all well aware that with Peter Lukas in charge of the Institute, it’s a very real danger to all of us. We are trying. Daisy, Basira and I, we don’t leave the Institute much anymore, so we do spend a lot of time together. It’s not that easy though.

.In February, I was in a relationship I didn't want to be in anymore, and the smiles were fake. Then I left my husband, and it was hard, then it got easier and I had friends and the smiles turned real. 

In early July I've now lost my best friend's, my roommates, I have my babies staying with a friend because I don't want them to see me like this, I've almost attempted suicide 3 times in the last month, I've lost 50 lbs, spiraled into an eating disorder, turned into a dangerous jaded cynical selfish piece of shit, and I can't even recognize myself apart from pictures from three weeks ago, let alone five months ago.

I almost killed myself Wednsday and it was the closest I ever came to guaranteed death, and I talked myself down, and I regret it? I just disappeared for two days, and I get home yesterday, and my best friend's upset his cat got out the night I disappeared and wasn't back yet? I felt like I was going to puke, and I still feel like my stomach is in my chest. How'd I fuck up so badly my best friend is more upset about his cat being lost a couple days than he was that I'm lost right now?

It feels like I never walked out of the woods. It feels like maybe I did fucking die or whatever part of me that actually wanted to live and not just go through the daily motions and survive is just dead? It feels like I'm watching myself from far away as everything I love crumbles, and it feels like I'm witnessing first hand and that I was right, everyone is better off without me. I'm slipping, and I'm slipping so fast I have nothing to hold onto. It honestly feels like I'm watching as people move on from me being in their lives, and I'm not even dead yet. I'm a ghost to everyone I love, and I'm still fucking alive to see it. 

I tried to go for a drive today, and all my music just reminds me of people I loved that are either dead now, or no longer love me. I can't listen to the music of my childhood without hearing the love of my life strumming along next to me and singing so badly while I sang over him. All our favorite alternative songs that used to be comforting are suffocating me now. All the music from the last few years makes me think of my ex husband and the awkward silences on car rides while the radio played a song I didn't have the energy to sing to anymore. Panic! Makes me think of the drives with the man I loved but never had the right to. Pink! Makes me think of the best friend that never came home to me and died on the way home to me instead. All the newest 200 or so songs make me think of the last few months with the best friendship I've ever known, the most my music taste has been expanded I years, and now every single fucking note makes me want to drive the car into a tree and never feel loss again.

I tried to take a few selfies today. I don't recognize myself. I look haunted, and hollow, and fucking empty. I look fucking soulless. Every single part of me that was me is gone and the last time I felt like this was at my best friend's funeral, staring down at her in the casket and everything in my brain screaming at me to walk away, look away, this isn't her anymore. 

This isn't me anymore. I'm not me anymore. I tried to get help last week. I went to the hospital I come back and everything is worse now. I wanted to kill myself last week, and I got help, and it didn't help. It didn't fix me. Nothing can fix me but everyone wants me to be fixed. I went in Tuesday, got out Saturday, and by Wednesday night I'm sitting in the woods holding razors and sobbing while I tried to think of any reason not to just let go. I found a reason, and I committed myself to really REALLY doing it. No more trying cause that leaves room for failing and I can't right? So I dye my hair my favorite hair color that I've kept it for so long to make myself feel better and more like myself, and it doesn't help. It doesn't feel like me. I get home I clean I take my meds I work I accomplish goals I bring my kids home and I feel so much better and my best friend comes home and I ask him if I'm allowed to just hug him and he says no. He still doesn't forgive me. 

I know they're going through things. I know I can't rely on them they can't pour from an empty cup and I'm fucking PROUD OF HIM for making choices in his life FOR HIM even if I don't agree with those choices. I'm proud of my other best friend and roommate for being so fucking strong and brave while her heart is shattered, but I'm not asking them to pour anything. I'm not asking them to fix me. I'm not asking them to guide me, I'm not asking them to let me lean on them, I just wanted them to stand by my side. I wanted anyone to just stand by my side because I can't save me from myself when the only thing that's kept me going for 11 years now is knowing how badly it would hurt the people I love, and now I know it's not true. It was selfish of me to expect them to care when they have their own shit to handle, but I don't care about me anymore and I just desperately need anyone else to. I just wanted to hang out. Go for a drive, listen to music play a video game do ANYTHING to distract myself from the fact that everything I love is systematically falling apart. I wanted to laugh again with the funniest man I've ever met. I wanted to parent my kids again with the best mom I've ever known. I wanted to clean the house with loud music and dance around with the kids surrounding us and sit at the table and maybe have someone to eat with that makes eating feel like less of a daunting task while I'm losing weight so rapidly my doctors are all concerned for my health and safety. Their other friends hang out, but their other friends aren't a fucking basket case like I am. I'm lonely, and I'm empty, and I'm sad, and I'm dejected, and I'm spiraling and self destructing and it's like I'm watching as everyone I love moves on from my loss while I'm still alive. I'm still right here, I feel like I'm made of glass and it's starting to splinter and pretty soon I'll just shatter completely and that will be the end of it.

Every reason I had to stay is crumbling. My kids deserve a mother that's not broken. My friends deserve a friend that isn't too broken to be around. They don't see the pain and the fear and the glass and the way I've turned into someone I don't know and don't recognize they don't see that I'm fucking pounding on the walls trying desperately to break them down and let someone in before I can't save me from myself anymore they just see the attitude and the rejection they don't see that the isolation isn't what I want or need. I don't want to be not home right now. I don't want to be not with my kids right now. I want to be me again. I want to be home and safe and loved and welcomed and I want someone to find me and see ME and see that I'm still alive and I'm still trying when everything in me doesn't want to anymore I'm giving it a chance I'm giving it a try and I'm failing so fucking badly because I'm doing it alone and it's officially the day I decided I'd kill myself if it didn't get better by July 4th. It's independence day. A day of freedom. The 5 year anniversary of my first suicide attempt. Things aren't better. They're worse. They're so much worse and every single day I wake up with hope and every single day I go to bed crying so hard no sound comes out.

But don't worry guys, for anyone wondering, their cat found his way home last night.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TW suicide

All our favorite alternative songs that used to be comforting are suffocating me now. All the music from the last few years makes me think of my ex husband and the awkward silences on car rides while the radio played a song I didn&amp;#39;t have the energy to sing to anymore. Panic! Makes me think of the drives with the man I loved but never had the right to. Pink! Makes me think of the best friend that never came home to me and died on the way home to me instead. All the newest 200 or so songs make me think of the last few months with the best friendship I&amp;#39;ve ever known, the most my music taste has been expanded I years, and now every single fucking note makes me want to drive the car into a tree and never feel loss again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to take a few selfies today. I don&amp;#39;t recognize myself. I look haunted, and hollow, and fucking empty. I look fucking soulless. Every single part of me that was me is gone and the last time I felt like this was at my best friend&amp;#39;s funeral, staring down at her in the casket and everything in my brain screaming at me to walk away, look away, this isn&amp;#39;t her anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t me anymore. I&amp;#39;m not me anymore. I tried to get help last week. I went to the hospital I come back and everything is worse now. I wanted to kill myself last week, and I got help, and it didn&amp;#39;t help. It didn&amp;#39;t fix me. Nothing can fix me but everyone wants me to be fixed. I went in Tuesday, got out Saturday, and by Wednesday night I&amp;#39;m sitting in the woods holding razors and sobbing while I tried to think of any reason not to just let go. I found a reason, and I committed myself to really REALLY doing it. No more trying cause that leaves room for failing and I can&amp;#39;t right? So I dye my hair my favorite hair color that I&amp;#39;ve kept it for so long to make myself feel better and more like myself, and it doesn&amp;#39;t help. It doesn&amp;#39;t feel like me. I get home I clean I take my meds I work I accomplish goals I bring my kids home and I feel so much better and my best friend comes home and I ask him if I&amp;#39;m allowed to just hug him and he says no. He still doesn&amp;#39;t forgive me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know they&amp;#39;re going through things. I know I can&amp;#39;t rely on them they can&amp;#39;t pour from an empty cup and I&amp;#39;m fucking PROUD OF HIM for making choices in his life FOR HIM even if I don&amp;#39;t agree with those choices. I&amp;#39;m proud of my other best friend and roommate for being so fucking strong and brave while her heart is shattered, but I&amp;#39;m not asking them to pour anything. I&amp;#39;m not asking them to fix me. I&amp;#39;m not asking them to guide me, I&amp;#39;m not asking them to let me lean on them, I just wanted them to stand by my side. I wanted anyone to just stand by my side because I can&amp;#39;t save me from myself when the only thing that&amp;#39;s kept me going for 11 years now is knowing how badly it would hurt the people I love, and now I know it&amp;#39;s not true. It was selfish of me to expect them to care when they have their own shit to handle, but I don&amp;#39;t care about me anymore and I just desperately need anyone else to. I just wanted to hang out. Go for a drive, listen to music play a video game do ANYTHING to distract myself from the fact that everything I love is systematically falling apart. I wanted to laugh again with the funniest man I&amp;#39;ve ever met. I wanted to parent my kids again with the best mom I&amp;#39;ve ever known. I wanted to clean the house with loud music and dance around with the kids surrounding us and sit at the table and maybe have someone to eat with that makes eating feel like less of a daunting task while I&amp;#39;m losing weight so rapidly my doctors are all concerned for my health and safety. Their other friends hang out, but their other friends aren&amp;#39;t a fucking basket case like I am. I&amp;#39;m lonely, and I&amp;#39;m empty, and I&amp;#39;m sad, and I&amp;#39;m dejected, and I&amp;#39;m spiraling and self destructing and it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m watching as everyone I love moves on from my loss while I&amp;#39;m still alive. I&amp;#39;m still right here, I feel like I&amp;#39;m made of glass and it&amp;#39;s starting to splinter and pretty soon I&amp;#39;ll just shatter completely and that will be the end of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every reason I had to stay is crumbling. My kids deserve a mother that&amp;#39;s not broken. My friends deserve a friend that isn&amp;#39;t too broken to be around. They don&amp;#39;t see the pain and the fear and the glass and the way I&amp;#39;ve turned into someone I don&amp;#39;t know and don&amp;#39;t recognize they don&amp;#39;t see that I&amp;#39;m fucking pounding on the walls trying desperately to break them down and let someone in before I can&amp;#39;t save me from myself anymore they just see the attitude and the rejection they don&amp;#39;t see that the isolation isn&amp;#39;t what I want or need. I don&amp;#39;t want to be not home right now. I don&amp;#39;t want to be not with my kids right now. I want to be me again. I want to be home and safe and loved and welcomed and I want someone to find me and see ME and see that I&amp;#39;m still alive and I&amp;#39;m still trying when everything in me doesn&amp;#39;t want to anymore I&amp;#39;m giving it a chance I&amp;#39;m giving it a try and I&amp;#39;m failing so fucking badly because I&amp;#39;m doing it alone and it&amp;#39;s officially the day I decided I&amp;#39;d kill myself if it didn&amp;#39;t get better by July 4th. It&amp;#39;s independence day. A day of freedom. The 5 year anniversary of my first suicide attempt. Things aren&amp;#39;t better. They&amp;#39;re worse. They&amp;#39;re so much worse and every single day I wake up with hope and every single day I go to bed crying so hard no sound comes out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t worry guys, for anyone wondering, their cat found his way home last night.&lt;/p&gt;

So when covid started to get serious (March 2020) I had so many plans. First of all I was going to go on a robotics competition at MIT, which was just a huge experience I would’ve love to have. Covid got this cancelled.

Next was my high school graduation, which has been postponed again and again (now it’s gonna be in December 2021 when it was supposed to take place on July 2020).

In summer I hit rock bottom, I was a candidate for a 70% scholarship for college, the final step was to attend a national bootcamp which was gonna be on another city with people from all over the country. Well, the event was online which fucking sucked since my home is not the most peaceful place. This caused many problems while being in zoom and of course I fucked up everything and got denied the scholarship. This actually got me depressed a lot, I stopped eating and getting out of bed was so difficult. 

Fast forward to august 2020, I started my first semester at college, spoiler alert, it fucking sucked. Everything was fucking online, I learned shit.

Fast forward now to January 2021, the whole fucking semester is also online, plus I haven’t met anyone from my classes because making friends via zoom is fucking imposible.

Now it’s summer 2021 and I am losing my shit, I keep telling my self this will end, but holy shit, I’ve spent 1/4 of college locked in my fucking apartment and I just like life is passing by and I am loosing so many experiences. Everyone always says that college is the best stage of their life and I am everyday sitting in front of my fucking computer learning shit, without friends and doing nothing.

How am I supposed to deal with this? Life feels tasteless. I am open for advice. Help

Both 37, married 10 years, things have been great lately, like best ever, but what are the odds that I fall off my meds for a few days and then this springs up and the emotions flood in.

Just a weird coincidence? It's almost making me laugh like how can this happen. Now I'm running through the day thinking she was acting weird and now I'm thinking it was some scheme that's been planned but I also have been through therapy and know not to trust these crazy feelings and to keep myself calm.

I tried once the school psychologist, but she didn't want to listen about my worries that I have depression. She helped me with my father and I don't listen that buying a bottle of water for me isn't worth and it's too expensive anymore, so she at least helped me in some sphere.

I have been simping girls since I was 6. I haven't been in serious relationship and I haven't had sex so far. Since I remember I used to have 1 friend, no more than just 1, who was often changing. When I turned 14, it was more difficult to me, so I kept looking desperately for anybody. At this moment, I have one friend who ""survived"" with me surprisingly long, because more than a year is a shock! For 5 years I can count on 1 hand amount of people with who I talk regularly even on chat. I don't go out more often than twice a month with this one friend, because I have no one else to see. It makes me lonely, and it made me addicted to ma******te. 

I resigned from all kinds of parties, because whenever I try to go for it, it's a disaster! School parties, parties in houses or in clubs, birthdays or anything else, it's always worse than i can even imagine. Last time I ran out crying to my car and I was sitting in there for 30 minutes after 20 min preparing for coming back there from the same car. I was scared and tired, I was so stressed that I vomit immediately everything I tried to eat, so I just drank water. I also completely resigned from drinking alcohol, in 2021 I am 100% clear. Since my 18th birthday (January 2020) I drank max. 10 beers up to August 2020. I used to be stood over by a lot of people on different levels of my education by age-mates. I was called ""fa**ot"", even by my father. I'd like to mention here that I always was straight. I keep social distanced, because I can't deal with people. I am boring and can't make anybody feel safe because I am weak physically and emotionally. I am lanky but useless. I have good grades, but I'm stupid.

I am retarded on relationships sphere, but I'm not dangerous or aggressive. I am werid and panic a lot. I want to cry in situations when there are a lot of people around me, like in theater. Because of that I'd love to move to introvertial Japan, but I'll come back to that later. I don't have any useful knowledge or skills that would let me become independent, so I am also addicted to my parents' will. I do everything so slowly and I don't have any power to live. I sleep 10 hours per day, then I go to my seasonal job, come back home, have 3h to waste and go to sleep again, it has some charm that I like. Tomorrow I'm getting results from exams I was writting at the end of high school, which will tell me if I have any chances to go to university, but I don't have big hopes. I'd like to be journalist or therapist, but I can't deal with myself, so where is dealing with other people?

I live with my parents and grandparents at the same time in the same flat. They are all far religious, so I don't have a choice when it comes to religion. I have to go to church once a week or I'll get punished by for example more practicing and praying. They used to breed me together because my parents work a lot so my grandparents were substituting them. I deal with 2 different types of breeding and I must satisfy them all by being nice and kind and do everything they expect and want from me. I am agnostic, but I must pretend I'm religious too. When I told honestly my father that I don't pray regularly at home, he treated me like air for 3 weeks - didn't talk to me, ignored me etc.

They're pragmatic and conservative so I sometimes treat them like they're dumber than me but they have 1 thing I am jealous of - will to live. I'd love to sleep forever, because I don't want to take responsibility for my life. I'd probably be already dead if I wasn't so scared of death, thanks to their influence. I don't have anybody who could help me with my hell, which I probably made for my own wish. I don't have power to live, people around me don't see life in me, I'm pessimistic and can't find any good feature in me. I am worthless and I get what I deserve.

I find pleasure in fanaticism and obsession. Firstly it were cartoons, then anime, now whole Japan. I am obsessed with it, I'd love to move there but I know that I'm blind and I don't see disadvantages. I have the feeling like only there I can achieve my biggest dream - happiness. I would probably reject every couple offer from local women because I only find Asian girls attractive. I'm more interested in their culture, art, nature, music and more than my local. Maybe I consider it as paradise because it's so far from my actual place of living, my family and more. Sometimes I feel it's achievable, but usually I treat it as dream which is impossible to achieve. 

I am so separated, but I don't feel any privacy out of my phone because of my brother with who I share my room, and we always get the same things. I feel like I were completely average, Grey person, but under tameness.

The worst thing is that I got used to everything of that - not having girlfriend and friends, being addicted and obedient to my family, being weak, dumb and childish, to being ugly and scared of everything. I don't want to change because it's out of my control, I don't want it and probably I wouldn't even have enough power to that. I know s*it and I don't know why I write this. One of my foreign mates from India told me to do that few times this year so I finally did that, but I already consider my life as lost. It all comes to time when I finally die but I don't even know if after death it will be better.

I love watching scars, ravens, blood (especially blooding wounds and eyes) and I tried to write a novel in my native language. I did it and published it so I know I left anything on this world but it won't succeed. I am completely apathic and lazy, and probably any help wouldn't let me live normally now, it's already too bad. It's all my fault and I know about it. Stuff like ""everything's gonna be OK"" or ""you need to take care of yourself and keep fighting"" don't work on me - it's done. Any speciallist haven't told me that I have depression, because I haven't visited any forever and I won't do it soon, because I don't have enough money.

Thank you for listening to me, I don't expect anything else from you now. I don't have hope, will or power to change my life, so it just depends on time when I'll be brave enough to start doing something... to end this. My best friends are funko pops of my favorite band... really, it's comedy, not tragedy.

I wish everyone all the best every time because I know how bad can life be and I don't wish it to anybody so please guys, if you're not that down yet, try!

I told him to fuck right off! I said “Shut up M, you’re not my dad. I’m NOT going to listen to you.” When I woke up I’m not gonna lie, remembering it made me smile. I think I still have issues that I probably should work out with M. I’m not going to though. Fuck that guy.
So, we finished eating. Why can’t I eat much when I eat? Why am I not feeling hungry, full, anything normal like that? My stomach just feels like a pit, or a black hole. Infinitely empty.

I have a weird thing about me and I don't know where to ask about it.

I'm not exactly depressed. I feel excitement about a lot of things, I work out, trying to eat healthier, study, work on my own small project. I would say I am perfectly fulfilled, but I can't feel joy.

More specifically joy when my partner is happy.

I don't know why, she told me that whenever she sees that I am excited about something , she also becomes happy, because I'm happy. 

But for some reason this doesn't work for me, whenever I see her being excited or happy about something, I do not become happy. I'm not sad either. Like my mood doesn't change.  


And when I think about I'm never really happy. I feel positive emotions, like excitement, intrigue, hype

Society has been destroyed.  Human beings are ultimately disposable.  Friendships get traded around like an old pokemon card.  Love is a transient affair based on sexuality, economics, or convenience, and not based on mutual interests, love, and meshing.  Our means of socializing in-person has become based in part on algorithmic assignment.  In 15 years dating websites, relationships were gamified and turned into a human casino by Match Group.  Fashion, clothing, and textiles has gone to cheap and disposable, like everything else.  Music has become no only even a chase for the next big hit, but endless pantomime of what came before and only in rare instances do these artists (if they even make their own music to any significant degree) act to CREATE instead of EMULATE.  Movies are endless reboots to capitalize on the lost talents of a bygone era, that or feature juvenile brightly-colored magical people to sell a pantheon to a population kept in neotony.  The human being has become a cookie cutter cardboard cutout of the same video game/anime/music/political cliches.  You meet one person, you met them all.  You can determine political beliefs by haircuts.  Kids barely even make bands anymore let experiment much with music.  The internet in this time, too, has gone from a vibrant series of small quaint tea houses, coffee shops, and boutiques to big box stores like Walmart and, quite literally, Reddit, Amazon, and Facebook.

I cannot survive in this suffocating world where nobody sees the gangrenous blight everywhere.  You cannot talk to anyone because you either already know what they are going to say (the lack of imagination and playfulness everywhere is more than easily visible) and they make their patterns so apparent within their dress and composure.   You cannot give anyone a chance because they are more likely than not going to use you for their own ends; after all, they don't value relationships, they value the cheap thrill of the moment and you're their current fix.  You'll be gone soon.

I wake up in these weird panic terrors at my helplessness because I am one of the very few that see it.  Nobody even shares my interests.  My intellectual interests are for me and me only, and I cannot connect with others on them because they just want to play video games.  We are all segregated by ""save the world"" politics where essentially modern Chalcedonians and Monophysites duke it out over the divine nature of the last guy the cops killed.

I have my ups and downs throughout the week and I’ve been consistently hitting more downs. I know this because I miss my old self, the girl who smiled at everyone and loved doing things to make other people happy.

I can’t keep shutting out the people i love and pushing my work aside until I “feel better” enough to do it. I hate this mentality and I want to snap out of it.

The past few weeks, I've been drinking at work (working from home an all that because of COVID). I had an episode on Tuesday and just thought to hell with it. I logged off, told my manager I won't be coming back. He's super cool and told me to just take the week off, clear my head, come back Monday and we'll talk. I never replied. The moment I logged off I knew it was time. I can't help but feel I've wasted my life. I look back at myself as a school kid who never paid attention at school, always tried my best to fit in and didn't give a damn about good grades. Boy, was I an idiot back then. It's a shame time travel hasn't been invented yet because I'd go back and give my 13 year old a kick up the ass. I've no friends anymore. I haven't  seem the closest friends I considered dear in my heart since 2018, 3 days before my birthday (one of my attempts). I took a walk around my town today. Walked past the house I grew up in, my old neighbourhood and stomping ground where my childhood friends would hang out. It hit me harder than I thought it would. Seeing those parts of town so different and renovated as to what I remembered them to be was heartbreaking. Things change. That's the way of life. I just don't think I'm ready for change.

First time poster. I&amp;#39;m planning on killing myself tonight. I think it&amp;#39;s about time. I&amp;#39;ve had maybe 2 or 3 attempts in the past  but this one feels like the one. I&amp;#39;m 30 years old, still live at home with my mum who I love. I work in a call centre. I&amp;#39;ve been there since March 2017. The past few weeks, I&amp;#39;ve been drinking at work (working from home an all that because of COVID). I had an episode on Tuesday and just thought to hell with it. I logged off, told my manager I won&amp;#39;t be coming back. He&amp;#39;s super cool and told me to just take the week off, clear my head, come back Monday and we&amp;#39;ll talk. I never replied. The moment I logged off I knew it was time. I can&amp;#39;t help but feel I&amp;#39;ve wasted my life. I look back at myself as a school kid who never paid attention at school, always tried my best to fit in and didn&amp;#39;t give a damn about good grades. Boy, was I an idiot back then. It&amp;#39;s a shame time travel hasn&amp;#39;t been invented yet because I&amp;#39;d go back and give my 13 year old a kick up the ass. I&amp;#39;ve no friends anymore. I haven&amp;#39;t  seem the closest friends I considered dear in my heart since 2018, 3 days before my birthday (one of my attempts). I took a walk around my town today. Walked past the house I grew up in, my old neighbourhood and stomping ground where my childhood friends would hang out. It hit me harder than I thought it would. Seeing those parts of town so different and renovated as to what I remembered them to be was heartbreaking. Things change. That&amp;#39;s the way of life. I just don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m ready for change. I think I&amp;#39;ve ranted enough. Not sure why I&amp;#39;m even posting here. It be cathartic, I dunno. Anyway, I hope whoever reads this finds the strength to go on. Don&amp;#39;t become an anorexic 30 year old with a drinking problem. It ain&amp;#39;t worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

Always just thought I was lazy, depressed, tired, lacked willpower and motivation, kindof stupid in common sense ways, etc. Then I heard people talking about ADHD and how it can manifest SO differently from ""hyperactive kid who can't listen"". 

I personally believe they should bring back the two distinct terms of ADD vs ADHD so more people know you don't have to be hyperactive. Now they call it all under ADHD but just say you're not predominantly hyperactive.

Anyway I thought meds wouldn't do anything to improve my life, as far as I knew they just calmed down hyper people so how would that work for me? Then I read about how it can completely change your motivation, make you productive and energetic, etc.

So I got diagnosed, tried medication and the first several did not work at all, they gave me horrible side effects and made me hyper but unfocused and felt like my head was full of bricks and I wanted to gnaw my fingers off. But I wanted to try all the options. 

Anyway long story short, I got on meds that work for me. I still have depression and anxiety but now I have some really good days and can actually be productive. On days where I take my pills and have gotten enough sleep, I can clean, survive the day without taking a random four hour depression nap, and even work on personal hobbies!!

How? When? Maybe things get better maybe they don't - the thing is will I even be alive for that to happen? How much more suffering and disappointment will I have to go through for things to happen?

I am trying. I have been trying all my life. I do not want advice or anyone telling me to try harder bc I've done /am doing that with prescribed meds therapy and through writing.

How will any of this help me get out of debt? How will this help me pay bills? How will this not make me be disabled bc of chronic pain? How can this help me get back into school? How will any of this help me at the very least get out of this abusive household and just living by myself where no one can bother me?

I feel like a complete sham, bc I'm the only one in this family still living with a miserable mother, lost my job due to chronic pain, lost job opportunities due to chronic pain, and I'm slowly losing passion for life.

No one is helping me.

Therapy makes me feel fake and doesn't get to the root of the problem

Clinically, diagnosed depressed (10+ years) , GAD (8 years) , ADHD (15+ years), and Ana B/P (3 years). 

TLDR: I worked pretty hard to stay recovered from my mental illnesses but am now really really bad, have no income and can't face anything.  Nothing is working and I feel hopeless.

I recovered almost completely (other than panic/phobias) for over a year when I was living abroad and met my partner.  

I had to leave as a result of the pandemic and moved back home about 10 months ago. 

I tried SO hard to keep up my healthy habits and my mental state. Right after quarantine, I moved into a new place with a roomate, I started a job within 3 weeks of getting home,  I went to the gym every day until they closed (2nd wave) and I kept eating an adequate amount of food. I barely if ever B/P'd and I tried my best to be social and make friends with my roommate and my colleagues from work. I had hobbies that I pushed myself to pursue, and I tried to keep a good sleep schedule.  

It did work for a while. But as my LDR began to get rough and I started to get overworked working two jobs to save to get back to my partner, things started to go downhill. 

It was super slow, but I started to feel angry and irritated most of the time. I started to obsess about my food intake because I couldn't go to the gym anymore. I started to B/P every week or two instead of every other month. I tried to cut down on work, but it didn't really seem to help. 

Then...  I got covid. 

At first I was just trying to make the best of it and see it as a welcome break. But it messed up my sleep schedule and my energy levels so bad that I got more and more depressed and ate less and less. After I recovered, I wasn't allowed to go back to work because I had long-lasting symptoms like a residual cough, was stuffed up, had lethargy and blood pressure issues etc. This really fueled the fired and I ended up in a full mental breakdown before I knew what was happening.  

I stopped taking my medication, ran away from my apartment for almost two weeks, stopped eating and sleeping. I couldn't face reaching out to the government for EI because for some reason it was so overwhelming that I would have panic attacks or detach from my brain and my body pretty heavily (STRONG depersonalization/derealization). I felt absolutely suicidally depressed one minute, and irrational and manic the next ( I do not have bipolar). I started B/Ping every spare moment I had and began to lose money and weight quickly. 

I eventually tried to get my shit together and went back home. Started my meds again, was luckily able to get into therapy and start an eating disorder program. While I am back to a more stable place in terms of not feeling. absolute extremes, snapping at everyone I know and feeling absolutely claustrophobic like I need to just get out and run away... things still feel like they're getting worse with no end in sight. 

I feel absolutely exhausted all the time. I feel like I'm living in a perpetual dream, and I feel so disconnected from my surroundings all the time and I find it difficult to hold conversations or even bring myself to look people in the eyes or respond to them. Everything just feels like ""nails on. a chalkboard"". Every sound, every stimulus. I feel like I can't bring myself to do almost anything more than get out of bed to go sit on the couch all day instead. Needless to say, I eventually lost my job, and now am making almost no money (thank god for my savings.... which are nearly depleted..) 

I have been back on my meds for a month and a half now and been going to therapy every week, but I just seem to get worse and worse. I don't know how to pull myself out of it. Nothing seems to help and none of what I learned in over 10 years of therapy seems to be getting through. 

Even as I write this, I feel so exhausted I can barely keep my eyes open and I have no drive or desire to do literally anything. 

I just want to feel better. I'm only 23. I have only held a steady job and maintained a happy healthy life for just over 1 year out of those 23. I don't want to be mentally unwell my entire life. I don't know what to do at this point. I feel like I'm working SO hard to do the things I need to do like therapy, medication,  being around my roomate or other people outdoors, trying to keep up SOME amount of my hobbies, getting outside for a walk every day,  trying to keep down at least a few healthy meals a day, journaling, getting enough sleep, meditations, etc etc etc. It didn't save me from the spiral and it's not pulling me out of it. I don't know what to do.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;23F&lt;/p&gt;

The reason for my depression is just life in general, we are forced to earn money to live because corporations own our existence. there is no choice, make money or be worthless. as a product,life is quite shitty, i didn't even want it. so as we do with products we don't like/want. i want to return it. and the only way i see to do that is to kill myself. life is such a burden and I don't want it anymore. it is pointless, it is stupid, it is just a waste of time.

&amp;#x200B;

can someone please explain to me, why is life supposed to be so precious? can someone please explain why i should feel happy to have this apparent privilege of being alive, it just seems like a lot of bullishit.

But last night I left the group. Over the last few months, I had a really bad chronic medical condition flare up. They stopped talking to me most of the time, and started playing a new game that they knew I couldn't join later on, as the themes were too dark for me.

i have no idea how to properly introduce this post, so im just going to dive right into it. hopefully it isnt too long.

for the past few weeks, i have felt like absolute shit. im currently writing this about twenty minutes after a mental breakdown, which consisted of me sobbing and practically begging for this mental anguish to cease. a few days ago, i had a similar experience, which actually resulted in me falling to the hardwood floor in a fit of tears. these mental breakdowns are completely new to me - ive never been the dramatic type when it comes to handling my emotions, but it feels almost painful to hold these things in. 

im a 17 year old boy who is currently trying extremely hard to recover from an eating disorder and deal with depression at the same time. for a while, everything was looking up for me. i was happy and eating normally again - i truly felt as if i was finally accomplishing something! it was an amazingly freeing feeling. 

i dont know what happened. im now back at square one - every time i pass by a mirror, i almost gag in disgust. i genuinely see myself as the ugliest person on earth, physically and mentally. i hate my face, my voice, my body, my personality, and everything about myself. 

when im not crying, i feel almost detached from everything, like im dreaming or watching a film. i never really socialize with people, aside from immediate family and small groups of friends. i feel so utterly alone. nobody seems to see how much pain im in, nor do they try particularly hard to check up on me personally. 

ive been getting frequent headaches from my crying, and have lost at least ten pounds in the past three months due to my eating habits. my mom has expressed concern for my health, but i absolutely despise the idea of making her worry, so i just cover it up with a smile and convince her that im alright, or that i can handle my hardships without any help. im stubbornly independent in every aspect of my life. 

i dont know what to do anymore. i feel so lost. i havent been in such a deep depressive episode since middle school. i feel unworthy and unloved. 

im not looking for any advice. i just needed to vent somewhere, i suppose. feel free to ignore this. im sorry.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;hi, all. &lt;/p&gt;

Secondly, every time I look back into my childhood, I can see how careless I was, how everything was just simpler and easier.

Or when I think about friends I used to have, it just feels so unfair that the older I am the lonelier I get.

So, in short, I guess my best friend is depressed and I wonder if I can do anything about it.

He's my neighbour and we met in 2016 and then on we became really good friends. I became closer of him and his school friends who are also cool as hell, and I used to go to his house every Saturday to watch movies together, play music, talk and joke around, or go to the mall, anyway, every Saturday we got together to do something. Since the pandemic started I've noticed that the frequency we hanged out has dropped a lot. I went there every Saturday, then after a while about twice a month, then just once a month, and now it's been almost 3 months since I call him every Saturday and we've never done anything together again. 

I have a hard time understanding people's feelings, so at the time I thought ""Wow, he's really trying to avoid me?"" and I was pissed because I like doing things with him so much and then out of the blue we just never did anything, but then I talked to my parents (they had depression) and they explained it better to me that he was actually depressive. I talked to his friends and they told me some info too.

I'll do a little list of what happened:

\- Before all of this, he always used to sleep and wake up very late. He usually sleeps around 4am and wakes up around 4pm), but he'd still join our discord calls to play and talk to us all the time. Now even though he sleeps/wakes up at the same time, he almost never join our discord calls again.

\- About him ""never"" joining us to play, it's not like he never ever join our calls anymore. I mean, he join us sometimes, but the frequency has dropped a LOT, he used to be online like, 5 out of 7 days a week, now he's only 1 if we're on a lucky day.

\- Her friends told me he's acting kinda ""whatever-ish"" with everything basically. They told me they've had a lot of school homework that they needed him to show up but he actually never showed up. He even replied in the groups with ""Fine, 7 o'clock I'll be online so we can do the homework"", but when the clock hit 7 he wouldn't appear. Just hours and hours later he'd just read and not reply the messages of people calling him or he'd just tell an excuse like ""Oh sorry, I was sleeping"". Their friends told me it's always like he ends up missing the time, and when he sees that it's been like 10 minutes that they already started a meeting, he's like ""I'm already late soo it's not even worth joining in""

\- Now at pandemic he basically only sleeps and watch movies, literally. I mean, Ofc we already hanged out on real life together and stuff, but when we call him to play or to hang out to the mall, or idk, do anything really, he just ghost us, either reading the messages inviting him to do something and never replying, or just not seeing them at ALL.

\- He vanishes for long hours and we don't have a clue why. He don't explain us what's happening, how is he feeling, if he actually wanna do something or not, he just read our messages and that's all, he vanishes. Never reply us with words.

\- I actually talked to our housekeeper maid (which is the same as his, she works in both houses) and she said she found anti-depressant pills and meds and all that stuff in the trash bin. 

\- The worst part is that his family doesn't help. His parents are divorced since he was born, but they're neighbours. His father is a doctor that's always out and his mom is a teacher. The fact is, at the free time even his mom always used to sleep and just wake up to play their piano and eat and then sleep again. Not because they're depressed too, but their parents just, idk, don't seem to care for him. If he doesn't shower they won't even bother asking him ""What's that smell?"". If he sleeps all day long, they don't bother saying ""Hey, you're only 15, you can't sleep all day long"". They don't bother with nothing, absolutelly nothing, they let him on his own, their parents just wake up to cook food and that's ALL, all they do is sleep. They probably don't even know he's depressed since they only sleep all day long...

\- I told all this to my parents and I decided to call him myself. One day I told him I had written a new song and asked him if he wanted to take a look. After long hours waiting, he replied 11:00pm ""Oh hey, Alright, but I'll be online just a little time today"". When he joined discord with me I asked him what was happening. He was pretty open, he told me he was using pills and meds and he was feeling kinda uninterested, he cried all the time and was feeling bad about something he couldn't tell what it was. He said he was very down because of the pandemic and school giving lots of homework and exams for them and stuff and told me actually lots of people around him are asking every day ""Is everything fine dude?"", and he said he felt better last week but now I can see It's getting worse again.

I mean, my parents had depression so I asked them what could I do, and my parents said ""Try calling him more often to go out and do things with you, ask him to go to the mall or ride your bycicles, and if he says he doesn't want to, force him by saying ""No, come on, complain after we did it"". Because if you give him the choice he'll never leave his house on his own, so pressure him to hang out with you.""

But Idk if that's the right way, and yet every single time I tried ask him to hang out or to play or do anything we used to, he won't even read my texts, he simply vanishes for long hours and don't even bother interacting with me or his friends. What can I do to help? I don't wanna see my friend this way, but how can anyone help him if he just vanishes and sleeps and... you know? I'm lost here, I wanna help him not getting worse but how? :(

TLDR: My friend is probably depressed. He only sleeps and wakes up to watch movies, vanishes for long hours and never replies to me and our friends messages. We hang out sometimes and he joins discord to play with us sometimes, but the frequency is getting always down and we're getting worried since he was never like that.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Idk if this is the right sub for this but I hope to find some answers here.

I mean, Ofc we already hanged out on real life together and stuff, but when we call him to play or to hang out to the mall, or idk, do anything really, he just ghost us, either reading the messages inviting him to do something and never replying, or just not seeing them at ALL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- He vanishes for long hours and we don&amp;#39;t have a clue why. He don&amp;#39;t explain us what&amp;#39;s happening, how is he feeling, if he actually wanna do something or not, he just read our messages and that&amp;#39;s all, he vanishes. Never reply us with words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- I actually talked to our housekeeper maid (which is the same as his, she works in both houses) and she said she found anti-depressant pills and meds and all that stuff in the trash bin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- The worst part is that his family doesn&amp;#39;t help. His parents are divorced since he was born, but they&amp;#39;re neighbours. His father is a doctor that&amp;#39;s always out and his mom is a teacher. The fact is, at the free time even his mom always used to sleep and just wake up to play their piano and eat and then sleep again. Not because they&amp;#39;re depressed too, but their parents just, idk, don&amp;#39;t seem to care for him. If he doesn&amp;#39;t shower they won&amp;#39;t even bother asking him &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s that smell?&amp;quot;. If he sleeps all day long, they don&amp;#39;t bother saying &amp;quot;Hey, you&amp;#39;re only 15, you can&amp;#39;t sleep all day long&amp;quot;. They don&amp;#39;t bother with nothing, absolutelly nothing, they let him on his own, their parents just wake up to cook food and that&amp;#39;s ALL, all they do is sleep. They probably don&amp;#39;t even know he&amp;#39;s depressed since they only sleep all day long...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- I told all this to my parents and I decided to call him myself. One day I told him I had written a new song and asked him if he wanted to take a look. After long hours waiting, he replied 11:00pm &amp;quot;Oh hey, Alright, but I&amp;#39;ll be online just a little time today&amp;quot;. When he joined discord with me I asked him what was happening. He was pretty open, he told me he was using pills and meds and he was feeling kinda uninterested, he cried all the time and was feeling bad about something he couldn&amp;#39;t tell what it was. He said he was very down because of the pandemic and school giving lots of homework and exams for them and stuff and told me actually lots of people around him are asking every day &amp;quot;Is everything fine dude?&amp;quot;, and he said he felt better last week but now I can see It&amp;#39;s getting worse again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, my parents had depression so I asked them what could I do, and my parents said &amp;quot;Try calling him more often to go out and do things with you, ask him to go to the mall or ride your bycicles, and if he says he doesn&amp;#39;t want to, force him by saying &amp;quot;No, come on, complain after we did it&amp;quot;. Because if you give him the choice he&amp;#39;ll never leave his house on his own, so pressure him to hang out with you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Idk if that&amp;#39;s the right way, and yet every single time I tried ask him to hang out or to play or do anything we used to, he won&amp;#39;t even read my texts, he simply vanishes for long hours and don&amp;#39;t even bother interacting with me or his friends. What can I do to help? I don&amp;#39;t wanna see my friend this way, but how can anyone help him if he just vanishes and sleeps and... you know? I&amp;#39;m lost here, I wanna help him not getting worse but how? :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: My friend is probably depressed. He only sleeps and wakes up to watch movies, vanishes for long hours and never replies to me and our friends messages. We hang out sometimes and he joins discord to play with us sometimes, but the frequency is getting always down and we&amp;#39;re getting worried since he was never like that.&lt;/p&gt;

I am so far gone, so separated from reality, that I have two states of mind: short-lived joys, and rational calmness. 

Let's start with short-lived joys. For me, I am in this state of mind as often as any healthy person, whether it be looking at memes, videos, movies, etc. or laughing and conversing with friends and colleagues. It's genuine joy, but when I say that it is short lived, I simply mean that it only lasts while in the moment and I will ultimately feel unfulfilled again. Joy is great, of course, but if I had to choose between joy and contentment/fulfillment, I'd pick the latter nine times out of ten. 

The second state of mind is, in actuality, much sadder than than its name makes it out to be: calmness. I have reached a level of hopeless that literally give me solace in the fact that I don't have to concern myself with hoping my circumstances change at some point. I don't think I have completely lost hope, yet, and I'll get to that in a second. But I have lost so much hope that I no longer feel sad or cry anymore.

I've also accepted that I am not a person that can create intrinsic motivation from nothing, and therefore will never amount to greatness. I just don't have the willpower or drive. A byproduct of so much lost hope is I don't have passion. For anything. Not ideologies, political beliefs, activities, hobbies, anyone, anything. The calmness has left my mind so hollowed that passion seems completely unattainable. 

I don't think I've lost all hope yet. I kinda wish that I would because maybe then I'd kill myself or at least not have it lingering in the back of my mind to gnaw at me. But there's so little that I shouldn't complain about it. It's just like a little mosquito bite that itches sometimes.

Well. This has been part of my life for over a week now. I really hope I am simply overthinking. I know he is going through a lot. 

I have no clue how to know if he's okay or not. I've been talking with him every day for a year, and now we haven't talked at all in almost two weeks, so it's a big adjustment. Which I'm sure may be even harder for him, considering what's going on.

I've been in period of severe depression for a while now, worse than I've ever had before (35, lived with depression and mental health issues all my life). Initially this latest depression was caused by heartbreak, after spending time with a friend who I'd fallen for I'd decided to finally tell her how I felt the next time we met (first time in my life I'd felt that way and was ready to confess), however just before that happened I found out she'd just started seeing someone else. That sent me into a terrible state of depression and neglect for self care, as well as over reliance/abuse of alcohol to try and cope. 

One night I reached out to my closest friend, however I wasn't thinking clearly, was still in a broken state mentally, and was heavily under the effect of alcohol, so in the course of that conversation I was in tears, not making sense, and seemingly saying 'goodbye' to my friend as I said I'd made the choice to dissappear. This conversation scared my friend, and she was worried what I might do to myself, it was also quite late at night and out of the blue, so this was also a lot for her to take. The result is I ended up scaring my friend, upsetting her, hurting her (emotionally), and pushing her away. I've tried a couple of times to apologise to her and have asked if I can have a chance to make things up to her, initially she seemed to forgive me and it looked like things were going to be ok, but the last few weeks it's become clear that isn't the case, and I'm not longer part of her life. She's shut me out and from what I can gather from a mutual friend, I've lost her for good.

That has actually ended up breaking me and sending me into a further depression and point which I feel I can't come back from. The heartbreak I was suffering from initially doesn't seem to matter anymore in comparison to this. I know this might sound silly, but I'm 35,and this small group of friends who I met these last few years are the only friends I've ever had. Out of them this friend who has shut me out now has been my closest friend and the most important person I've ever had in my life! I can't describe everything and all the reasons why, but she's been such a big part of my life, always supportive, caring, and fun to be around, her energy and positivity lit up my life. I don't know how to go on now, I feel there's almost no point in me trying to get myself back to normal because there is no normal without her in my life. If I've lost her as a friend then it feels like my life is over and a large part of me has died. I know some people will just say 'get over it, make other friends', but that isn't how it works! I can't get over it, I don't want to make other friends, she is irreplaceable and will always be in my heart. Losing my friendship with her is it for me, I can't bare the thought of life without her as my friend.

So I'm in a position where the only thing that will help me and can get me out of this depression is if my friend ends up forgiving me and restoring our friendship, but she's shut me out of her life, so I'm forever stuck in this hell. I can't blame anyone other than myself as it was my state that drove her away, and I understand things from her point of view, it's her choice if she doesn't see me as a friend anymore. I've tried seeking professional help, and even started therapy, but none of that has helped/is helping, as my depression now is coming from losing the best friend I've ever had. And no amount of medication or therapy can fix that situation, only she can if she decides to forgive me, which of course she may choose not to. 

So I've lost the only person who can save me. She's the one person in the world who can make everything better and make my life go back to normal, but I've scared her away from my actions that night and I don't know what more I can do. Another mutual friend of mine said to give her time and space, but in my experience giving people time and space doesn't lead to forgiveness, it leads to being forgotten.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m feeling so lost right now. I&amp;#39;ve been in period of severe depression for a while now, worse than I&amp;#39;ve ever had before (35, lived with depression and mental health issues all my life). Initially this latest depression was caused by heartbreak, after spending time with a friend who I&amp;#39;d fallen for I&amp;#39;d decided to finally tell her how I felt the next time we met (first time in my life I&amp;#39;d felt that way and was ready to confess), however just before that happened I found out she&amp;#39;d just started seeing someone else. That sent me into a terrible state of depression and neglect for self care, as well as over reliance/abuse of alcohol to try and cope. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One night I reached out to my closest friend, however I wasn&amp;#39;t thinking clearly, was still in a broken state mentally, and was heavily under the effect of alcohol, so in the course of that conversation I was in tears, not making sense, and seemingly saying &amp;#39;goodbye&amp;#39; to my friend as I said I&amp;#39;d made the choice to dissappear. This conversation scared my friend, and she was worried what I might do to myself, it was also quite late at night and out of the blue, so this was also a lot for her to take. The result is I ended up scaring my friend, upsetting her, hurting her (emotionally), and pushing her away. I&amp;#39;ve tried a couple of times to apologise to her and have asked if I can have a chance to make things up to her, initially she seemed to forgive me and it looked like things were going to be ok, but the last few weeks it&amp;#39;s become clear that isn&amp;#39;t the case, and I&amp;#39;m not longer part of her life. She&amp;#39;s shut me out and from what I can gather from a mutual friend, I&amp;#39;ve lost her for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That has actually ended up breaking me and sending me into a further depression and point which I feel I can&amp;#39;t come back from. The heartbreak I was suffering from initially doesn&amp;#39;t seem to matter anymore in comparison to this. I know this might sound silly, but I&amp;#39;m 35,and this small group of friends who I met these last few years are the only friends I&amp;#39;ve ever had. Out of them this friend who has shut me out now has been my closest friend and the most important person I&amp;#39;ve ever had in my life! I can&amp;#39;t describe everything and all the reasons why, but she&amp;#39;s been such a big part of my life, always supportive, caring, and fun to be around, her energy and positivity lit up my life.

Had my surgery Wednesday and oh my God I’m losing my mind. I hate this. I hate being confined like this. I’m so lonely and I hate it.

So Iam 23 years old right now and Iam really not sure if this happened only to me (probably not) or if it is a common thing in here, but I have been depressed for as long as I can remember and I don't have any suicidal ideation but I have always dreamed for things to just.. end
The two main problems that have always haunted me is
1)How purposeless life is and 2)how lonely I always feel

As for the first point, it is really too hard to discuss this point thoroughly, but to sum up my point I went through all religions (the ones that I know off atleast) and I really followed the one that gave me most satisfaction, don't want to go in details regarding religion but yeah it gave me an ultimate goal which most religions follow in a way. Which is giving a moral compass to the people (an obvious point.. duh, but the details in religion are more satisfactory)
Following the first point, I chose a career that I found quite challenging and rewarding, medicine (specifically surgery). I chose this career to help as much as I can and trying to satisfy my hunger of purpose by getting this recognition (spoiler it still didn't do the trick)
I tried to do many things more like hobbies and working out, but here is the problem...
I STILL lack purpose and satisfaction in my life
And I always feel this endless void consuming me from within and I really don't know how to quinch 

As for the second thought and the my own nightmare, loneliness...
I really am blessed in this life with many things. Health, good friends and family.. but I still ALWAYS look so lonely that I can't bare the idea of my existence! And as I mentioned I DO have a good loving family and few but really faithfull and fun friends but that did not help at all, but the exact opposite because if they were the reason in any way then that would have been my escape or a justified reason for this feeling

So everyone... what... what can I do?
Knowing that I also started taking anti-depressant for 3 months, it helped with the symptoms but not the origin

Sorry for the long post and really... thank you for sharing your time with me","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, so this is my first post in reddit, I have been creeping out here for a long time but now I need help more than ever in this specific matter. So Iam 23 years old right now and Iam really not sure if this happened only to me (probably not) or if it is a common thing in here, but I have been depressed for as long as I can remember and I don&amp;#39;t have any suicidal ideation but I have always dreamed for things to just.. end
The two main problems that have always haunted me is
1)How purposeless life is and 2)how lonely I always feel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the first point, it is really too hard to discuss this point thoroughly, but to sum up my point I went through all religions (the ones that I know off atleast) and I really followed the one that gave me most satisfaction, don&amp;#39;t want to go in details regarding religion but yeah it gave me an ultimate goal which most religions follow in a way. Which is giving a moral compass to the people (an obvious point.. duh, but the details in religion are more satisfactory)
Following the first point, I chose a career that I found quite challenging and rewarding, medicine (specifically surgery). I chose this career to help as much as I can and trying to satisfy my hunger of purpose by getting this recognition (spoiler it still didn&amp;#39;t do the trick)
I tried to do many things more like hobbies and working out, but here is the problem...
I STILL lack purpose and satisfaction in my life
And I always feel this endless void consuming me from within and I really don&amp;#39;t know how to quinch &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the second thought and the my own nightmare, loneliness...
I really am blessed in this life with many things. Health, good friends and family.. but I still ALWAYS look so lonely that I can&amp;#39;t bare the idea of my existence! And as I mentioned I DO have a good loving family and few but really faithfull and fun friends but that did not help at all, but the exact opposite because if they were the reason in any way then that would have been my escape or a justified reason for this feeling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So everyone... what... what can I do?
Knowing that I also started taking anti-depressant for 3 months, it helped with the symptoms but not the origin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long post and really... thank you for sharing your time with me&lt;/p&gt;

""Man never ceases to regret, that is why in sleep he can find a rest that only death could guarantee him.  The sad man, you will notice, always try to do the least, and to sleep as long as possible: every moment in the world of dreams is a moment spent far away from this bitter reality that he seeks to avoid.  So what if our dreams took us away, took possession of us?  We and all of our repressed wishes and regrets, suddenly we would go mad and, or suicidal.
 So what about those who start from a nightmare and join a much worse one?
 In this room there is only him, him and his memories, him and his regrets, him and these numerous obsessive neurosis.  What about the nightmares he just had?  Is he in reality or in another one of those allucinations that his corrupt brain forces him to look at?
 His gaze falls everywhere on the walls of these narrow walls.  Watery eyes watch him, yet that's not what scares him.  Not in reality what he fears is the possibility that he has just woken up.
 Then he comes into contact with those eyes which remind him of painful memories.  Then suddenly an eye falls.  He picks it up with difficulty, having difficulty in appreciating the distances.  After having observed it for a long time, he swallows the eye as a test.  He smells the taste beautiful and well in one eye, he is disgusted by it, vomiting his disgust, he is surprised to have forgotten the taste.
 When he leaves the room he finds only mirrors, thinking, he loses his memory and wonders what he was doing here.
 In a burst of shame he hides his eyes so as not to see the reflections of these bloody mirrors.
 When after 12 minutes he removed the cover in front of his eyes.  He observed that he was in an alley.  The alcohol must have given him all these visions he thought, so he stood up, though staggering, and walked to where his body wanted to take him.
 Suddenly the rain began to fall, reminding him of a scene he wanted to forget.  Suddenly, two men pass in the narrow aisle, one holding a doll in his hands, and the other a ruddy bag.
 It was too much, he had to hide, the evil had no face other than his own, and knowing it hurt like hell, his heart twisted in his rib cage.
 Why now ?  Why in front of him?  He has been fleeing this past for 3 years.  So as usual he turned his head and closed his eyes, hearing only the sound of cries of women and children.  Then at the end of this cacophony, he heard the noise of plastic that crashes on the ground, as well as that of cooking.
 Praying to die he opened his eyes, seeing himself in a white room, empty of all feeling.  His eyes close slowly, permanently.  His last memory will be confused, what did he see?  What is the reality?  Anyway, he doesn't have to worry about it, because he knows that when his eyes are definitively closed, he returned to hell.""","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a poem / story that i translated from french, that is probably not as good as it sounded to me.

Also work had been a bit busier than usual but nothing I can't handle. I've been a bit tearful at times but I've just got on with it i suppose despite feeling generally quite low.

We've been together for a few years. Now part of me thought I would go mad, shout and scream etc. I had tears coming from my eyes but I wasn't proper crying it was weird.

Since covid I have dropped a lot of friends, gave up on family, ended up not getting my diploma from uni, ended a relationship with a girl who really cared about me, and have no inkling of an idea for a job that calls to my passion. Only thing i really excel at is video games but it’s too late to pursue that talent now (truly) so i have been in a fog for a while trying to figure things out - especially finding a job that I’ll enjoy.  I ended up going for doordash temporarily but working long hours doing so makes me irate. I really have no idea where I’m gonna go. I feel like a failure to everyone in my life and with student loan payments about to hit me in November, i really don’t know how I’ll survive. However, I’m still able to find meaning in my day to day. Perhaps it’s because I’m still with parents and not completely homeless that makes me feel secure deep down, but with everything aforementioned my pride is non existent and confidence 0%; yet willing to live 100%.

So i come here to offer up my subjectivities because I’ve been reading a lot of suicide mentions and i don’t believe ya’ll should go through with it.

My argument for existence over death is simple: the senses. When you die (assuming there is no after life) there is nothing. ‘Nothing’ can’t be measured, felt, or expressed because human consciousness don’t compute like dat. Even though i wake up every single day feeling like absolute shit inside, i am still able to feel, listen, see, smell, move, and think. And hell some days… i take that for granted.  The days i get embarrassed, make a mistake, injure myself, remember trauma, or get treated with disrespect… i wanna end it all.. but fuck em. 

There is something really special about being alive - even from a strictly selfish point of view. Feeling pain, loneliness, embarrassment, discomfort, and or thinking thoughts of pure mortal dread reminds us that life is poetically hellish. However.. that pain (whether physical or form in thought) is good because it reminds you that you can sense existence. You can breathe and create metaphor, wonder and look up to the stars. There’s philosophy and music, genius anime and captivating film. There’s sex (porn doesn’t count as feeling sex) and great tastes. There’s laughter, horror, romance.. and to top it all off: there’s others who sense like you - who appreciate the same things and chase after similar goals, but also there are others that feel similar dread and worry about same type of situations. Now if you’re like me, you probably won’t meet those people in real life.. but they exist, and there’s comfort in knowing that. You aren’t alone - in theory. But you have to embrace that and enjoy the selfishness of your life for what it is: sensed. Dying won’t do any good; if you feel like a burden on life then life has yet to match you. But please.. be okay with being a ‘burden’! BE A FUCKING BURDEN DUDE! Who cares?? Word probably is.. you feeling like a burden (assumption) is actually you feeling insecure about being yourself. And such feeling probably comes from judgment by an environment that is completely disassociated from your personality - only to be placed on you because of mere chance. After all.. you didn’t ask to live during the internet boom/meta.

Listen i can’t make you do anything.. perhaps I’m writing this so i distract myself from going down that rabbit hole, but i will tell you that if you allocate focus to the essence behind your senses (touch, taste, smell, vision, thought, and sound) i think there is a lot to appreciate which makes life worth living. I’m not gonna say there’s people who care about you, cuz well.. there may well be no one (I’ve accepted this about myself), but humanity  - regardless of the bad - has presented a lot of great things from within its wake, and it’s thanks to the senses. 

You don’t have to be rich, popular, or situated in a loving family. Or maybe you do.. and if so.. be quick about it. You have to start somewhere.. and when deciding on how to, with no proper instruction, it’s best to just take the ol’ fashioned risk and keep asking people your questions until you figure it out. But until you decide when to start (fuck procrastination) enjoy the gift of life - the senses - while you can. 

Do not fear death, but don’t rush it. 

Good luck everyone. Thanks for reading.

&lt;p&gt;Listen i can’t make you do anything.. perhaps I’m writing this so i distract myself from going down that rabbit hole, but i will tell you that if you allocate focus to the essence behind your senses (touch, taste, smell, vision, thought, and sound) i think there is a lot to appreciate which makes life worth living. I’m not gonna say there’s people who care about you, cuz well.. there may well be no one (I’ve accepted this about myself), but humanity  - regardless of the bad - has presented a lot of great things from within its wake, and it’s thanks to the senses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to be rich, popular, or situated in a loving family. Or maybe you do.. and if so.. be quick about it. You have to start somewhere.. and when deciding on how to, with no proper instruction, it’s best to just take the ol’ fashioned risk and keep asking people your questions until you figure it out. But until you decide when to start (fuck procrastination) enjoy the gift of life - the senses - while you can. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not fear death, but don’t rush it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck everyone. Thanks for reading. &lt;/p&gt;

I don’t look forward to anything. I don’t want anything, except to not have to feel anymore. I used to want things but all that’s done for me is open my eyes to why I either can’t have those things or don’t want those things. I wish I could just think super hard and give myself an aneurysm or a heart attack or something and then it would just be over. 

Nothing gives me purpose. I derive no meaning from any sort of work. I don’t like to create things and I lack the focus to anyway. Helping people doesn’t make me feel anything at all. The is no meaning to my life at all and I can’t give myself any no matter what I try.

The only eventful thing that seems to happen in my life is that I constantly get completely crippled by my own mind. I feel like I’m living on a planet where for some reason gravity acts much stronger on me so everyone else seems to be able to walk around with no issues but even just standing up is a constant battle for me and I just look like a freak because no one else around me feels what I feel and they can’t see it either so they don’t understand.

Nice thing to say to someone who is already suicidal and thinks everyone hates them and doesn&amp;#39;t care about them. And I have ALWAYS been there for her. When she was depressed, when she had panic attacks, when she was in an abusive relationship for years, I never left her side EVEN THOUGH it cost me very much energy and I was also dealing with my own shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fucking hate people and I don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;m still doing here. Clearly no one gives a fuck about me. I&amp;#39;m a burden. It&amp;#39;s not convenient for them. Blablabla. Fuck that and fuck all of them. And they will all cry when I&amp;#39;m dead and say they did everything they could. They didn&amp;#39;t. I already wrote my suicide note a few weeks ago but I&amp;#39;m making some adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know my parents want the best for me but they&amp;#39;re alcoholics and can&amp;#39;t talk about emotions so they can&amp;#39;t support me either. No one can. And yes I&amp;#39;m on medication and I&amp;#39;m going through therapy. Not really helping apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

I had 3 suicide attempts and depression. Why is it that even after years i feel like Im 11 or 12 years old, seeing other children play hurts me mentally because i know I will never be able to go back to that..

I took/am taking 1.5 yrs off school for mental health and to save up tuition money, but my mental health has been constantly deteriorating and the only way I could (somewhat) preserve it would affect my savings.

I (22F) have been living with my aunt and uncle for 5-ish months and my aunt takes issue with and belittles me for my ""lifestyle choices,"" ie how all my outfits ""look the same"", I don't own any ""nice"" clothes, I leave my clothes on the floor, I don't leave the house except for work or grocery shopping, I don't cook meals from scratch, I don't wear makeup, I don't go on dates, I don't socialize/have friends in the area, *and* that I go to counseling (a ""cash grab/scam"").  
I absolutely hate it, and every time I speak up and tell her I don't like it she calls me sensitive/touchy/some other adjective with the same meaning. If I say that I'm stressed at my job, she'll say that she's had horrible jobs in the past but she stuck with it cause she had kids to feed and bills to pay; if I reference my mental illness, she'll say that she used to be terribly depressed and s\*icidal but she buckled down and made it through it; if I vent or worry about tuition costs, she'll say that she also had to take out a loan and work a part-time job to get through college and she managed it just fine. It's a constant series of dismissals and 'I had it worse' and it just wears me down.  
She also doesn't hold back from doing this in public in front of strangers/her friends, which is why I now avoid going on shopping trips with her, eating out with my aunt and uncle when they invite me, or going to church with them. All of this causes her to become more upset and judgmental of my choices.

I hate this so much. She speaks to my uncle in much the same way, says that he ""wants everyone to like him"" whenever he acts considerate of strangers (letting a car merge, is patient with a new employee, etc), so at least there's comfort in knowing it's not just me. This has also provided invaluable insight into why my older cousin was considered a ""problem child;"" she has strong boundaries and doesn't put up with other peoples BS.

Moving back with my parents isn't an option, and while I could technically afford living on my own if I got another job, but having just one job is so draining already and I don't know if I could handle it. Additionally, I'm taking time off from school to save money and living alone would be a drain on my savings and make the whole gap year (and a half) pointless.

I just don't know what to do. To be honest, it's not just living with my aunt; everything in my life has been pretty shitty since last September. This is only the latest stressor.

Hello, for background I have ptsd &amp; hypomania, bipolar 2. 
I’m the youngest of the family by quite some years. My dad just lost a 2 year battle with cancer as of June 25th, 7 days now. I haven’t been working for the last 7 months now. I quit abruptly one morning before work becausei was overly stressed out. My gf was in and out of hospitalization from a recent schizoaffective disorder diagnosis along with my dad being sick, and the children I was taking care of at work were coming home full time along with their friends I’d watch w no compensation. Anyways I’m an avid dumpster diver &amp; have been for 2.5 years now. I make enough money to pay my bills doing that. I’m ready to work. I think. I am incredibly depressed but the mania is eating me alive.  I just applied for Medicaid so I can have help w a therapist. I just feel like I’m losing my mind. There’s a lot going on that I can’t wrap my head around and I want to escape. I want to be happy again. I moved to south Florida 5 years ago &amp; stayed for 2 years before moving back and I swear I haven’t been happy since. I feel trapped. I have a great family here don’t get me wrong but we all live very different lives. I have no friends at home so I feel incredibly alone. I do have one friend I have had since middle school but she is a mom of 3 so she is very busy. My mania is telling me to get on my shit so I can leave. I WORK. I like to work. This last year I haven’t and it has been very weird. I’m social and I do not have that anymore. I don’t want to leave my family during such a confusing time, but I feel like I need to BUT my depression leaves me to sulk in bed, dream of everything I know I can do with determination. Yet I do nothing. My mom was a stay at home mom, I saw her at home so I don’t know if I see that and think well I’ll be all right cus mom was, or if it’s the fact that as long as I’m not on drugs no one seems to care what anyone is doing. I get things done with encouragement. As soon as someone tells me to do something I do it instantly, but I cannot do it on my own. The things I know I can do my brain tells me I can’t. I feel like an imposter. I’m losing it and my gf is a huge distraction. I love her but not that way anymore. I know it’s wrong. I am I love w someone else. They’re in Florida, we are friends there hasn’t been any cheating whatso ever, but for 2 years I have thought of him day in and day out. I do think it sounds nuts but I didnt plan life to be this way. And I’m so worried to hurt her (gf) After her diagnosis. Itso fucked. I also just bought a 2500 car that is shit… I didn’t realize the floor board was rusted out so there the cherry on that. I’m manic and depressed at the same time and have no fucking clue what’s happening. Usually it’s one or the other. What do I do? What have youDone to help if you can relate? Or any advice really.

I was born to an affluent family

I go to a private school

I’ve been made fun of and bullied since I was 5.

I get laughed at for the most random things which everyone does. I got ridiculed for having a crush on a girl.

Every time I make a small mistake, I get yelled at constantly by everyone.

Not a single adult knows about any of this.

When I tell my classmates about my issues, (notice how I don’t call them friends, more on that later) they laugh at me and say I’m completely fine.

I dont have any friends. People around me say they’re friendly with me, but its only when they need something. When I require support in any way, no one is there.

My parents are very good and hard working people, but they are very pressurizing towards me, but I guess thats just the Indian mindset. 

I have attempted suicide numerous times during lockdown, (I lost count). I try to suffocate myself while sleeping cuz I think that would be the most painless way to go.

No one ever acknowledges my good work/deeds, but always focus on the negatives, no matter how small they are. If I get a 97/100 in a practice paper, my parents always point out stuff like “Why did u lose 3 marks” and “Why is your handwriting so bad”
“If you weren’t so lazy and unaccomplished, you would do better in life” (the last comment is a recurring theme)

I’m also very harsh on myself. For example, sometimes I think I’m a self-serving narcissist because I refused to help a classmate with some work. This is probably because of the values I was raised with, where I should help everyone and stuff like that.

The only reason I exist right now is to enjoy Youtube videos, play Valorant, sleep, and listen to The Beatles, Nirvana, Eminem, and Bob Dylan.
Also I’m looking forward to my IGCSE exams, so that I hopefully do well in them and not be a complete disappointment to my parents.

For over a year now.. I have suspected I had depression.
I don't want to say 100% I do, since I have not been professionally diagnosed and I do not have the courage, or the money to ask my mom to take me to see a professional..
In the mornings, they aren't bad, because I usually talk to my online friends to keep me company, it's usually when I'm completely alone, especially when it's night that the bad thoughts start flooding in.
I really.. hate myself.. I feel talentless.. I have this overwhelming fear that I won't live up to my own or even the world's expectations, that I'll die alone.. I look in the mirror and I don't.. like me... I understand that I'm annoying, I understand that in the end my experiences aren't as important as others, that I'm just a stupid kid that'll never survive the real world.
And.. these feelings I've been dealing with.. since early 2020.
I think these thoughts, along with a regrettable reliance on the internet has caused some form of insomnia. 

Now.. the reason I decided to post this here is that I'm scared.. to tell my mom..
I have a friend that I have told about my feelings and they've helped a little, but I don't really want to just dump everything on them.. the reason I'm afraid to tell my mom is.. because recently my dad died and we are struggling financially.. there's a possibility we won't be able to afford a proper funeral..
So I can't imagine the pain and fear it would put on my mom, that after loosing the love of her life, that her own daughter, feels so worthless.
I don't necassarily want to end my life.. because that's just more pain on my mom.. I know other people in my city won't care if I'm gone.. at the same time life doesn't exactly feel worth living either...
In a way I'm.. scared to die...
That sounds stupid I know it does.

Overall I'm just.. loss... I don't even know if this even is depression or not.

These are all of the medications I’ve been on over the last seven years: 

Fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem)

Sertraline (Zoloft)

Venlafaxine (Effexor) BAD

Duloxetine (Cymbalta) BAD

Bupropion (Welbutrin, Aplenzin) 

Mirtazapine (Remeron)

Lamotragine (Lamictal)

Quetiapine Fumarate (Seroquel) 

Clonazepam (Klonopin)

Lorazepam (Ativan)

Alprazolam (Xanax)

Escitalopram (Lexapro) 

None of them have “worked” for longer than a couple of months. I’m currently being seen by a gastroenterologist for horrible GI issues and am pretty confident that in a couple of days they’re going to tell me all of my problems are stemming from taking SSRIS because 90% of your serotonin receptors are in your gut and being on these pills can be hard on your stomach.

If they tell me that I can’t take SSRIS anymore, where does that leave me? I was interested in getting ECT until I read about the horrible years long side effects it can leave you with and now I feel like I’m out of options because I’ve tried so many types of pills. 

Obviously a psychiatrist is the one who will decide what I do next if I can’t have my SSRIS anymore, but I won’t be able to see one for another month or so and I’m feeling anxious about what lies in store for me treatment-wise. I’m just wondering if there’s something besides ect or weekly therapy that could be recommended to me?

&lt;p&gt;My life is okay but I often hate it and wish I could be someone or somewhere else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions? Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

As the years went by i went through 3 of their separations since they wanted to work it out but honestly i think they didn't want to be a lone as we live away from any family since everyone lives in a different country. until i got to jr year of highschool i met her. what i felt was the only ray of sunshine i had so i didn't want to lose it and made my self a promised not to do what my parents did.

At that time my parent were doing better they stopped fighting everything they made up completely and they called me i said i had trouble in life They told me to go live with them since i had no one else since and i never told never told them what happen since i was a 3 they always told me never talk with people with what is private and to not tell other with what is happens inside the house as it private and other people don't need to know since its not their business to know maybe that's why i could never open up to anyone completely and before you guys asked she knew a little but not everything since that was driven in to my head like a religious scripture. 6 years has passed i haven't told any one any of this and this whole time i just felt like i have been in auto pilot and i have tried to fill the gap with anything but i couldn't ever.i just didn't have the strength to move forward. my parent never thought that something was wrong since for the depression only happen when you're not happy and since they saw me smiling and laughing and with that mind set i thought i wasn't and with what i felt was normal once again. in the end i got addicted to smoking weed taking edible since it was the fastest i could get and the only time i didn't feel anything was when i was high. i tried multiple time to get stronger things but i always stopped my self at the last moment.

At the beginning of 2021, my partner and I started fresh as we relocated for his work - an exciting new chapter that I was so pumped for. A fresh start and new hope. Only it doesn’t feel that way.

7 months on and I constantly feel alone and isolated. I don’t have any real, true friends (or any for that matter) and the only people I do know feel more like acquaintances, just surface level relationships that have been formed since the change of area. I don’t talk to family much either. I’ve never had many friends and have struggled finding like minded people. At the beginning of 2020 I had a falling out with a high school best friend which has since never been repaired (although hard at the time, it was for the better). I’ve now just recently gone through another rough patch with my only friend of the last 1.5 years and don’t see it surviving long term.

I now just feel that no one has a genuine interest in me so I hold my cards close. I hardly reveal how I am really feeling. Everything mostly feels like an act.

be a thriving human being instead of someone who doesn’t even understand themselves anymore. I feel so deep in a spiral and I don’t know where it’s headed. I’ve lost all confidence and feel scared to speak up in fear of rejection or social humiliation.

https://old.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/obwlql/day_1/

I just took my first dose of the new medication that my psychiatrist prescribed.  I am on Abilify-- she wants me to take a quarter of my 10mg (so 2.5mg) for about a week and then slowly increase little by little.  I am VERY nervous because I had so many side effects from Latuda when I first started it-- the worst thing was the akathisia!

I went to work today and afterwards, went to a meeting with my local community garden.  Afterwards, a couple of us were invited to one of the lady's houses to see her home garden and to have some wine on her front porch.  On the drive over, I was just thinking to myself that even though I REALLY wanted to find an excuse to not go, I NEED to force myself to do things like this to invest in my future happier self.  

I like one of the ladies more than the rest-- she's more my age and she just seems really friendly.  Today, when it was just the two of us on the porch at one point, we were both laughing at ourselves because we BOTH confessed that we thought about bailing because we feel so socially awkward and, it just so happens that we both didn't want to be rude and decline the host's wine (I don't know her reasons and she sure as hell doesn't know mine haha) but I actually DID decline and got a water instead.  It wasn't a big thing at all but I am so fucking proud of myself for not having a drink-- normally I would find this to be the perfect excuse to cheat.  But dude, it's DAY 2, I can't do that to myself already!  I also haven't smoked weed even though it is all RIGHT there and my partner is smoking tonight.  

So I just wanted to say that tonight, I feel a little hopeful.  I am proud of myself for doing the right things today.  I really hope that I can keep it up-- I really need to give this a real shot.  I'm so sick of feeling depressed.  I hope at least that the Abilify doesn't make me sick or uncomfortable tonight!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess I&amp;#39;ll just link my first post here in case anyone reads and wants to know any backstory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to work today and afterwards, went to a meeting with my local community garden.  Afterwards, a couple of us were invited to one of the lady&amp;#39;s houses to see her home garden and to have some wine on her front porch.  On the drive over, I was just thinking to myself that even though I REALLY wanted to find an excuse to not go, I NEED to force myself to do things like this to invest in my future happier self.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like one of the ladies more than the rest-- she&amp;#39;s more my age and she just seems really friendly.  Today, when it was just the two of us on the porch at one point, we were both laughing at ourselves because we BOTH confessed that we thought about bailing because we feel so socially awkward and, it just so happens that we both didn&amp;#39;t want to be rude and decline the host&amp;#39;s wine (I don&amp;#39;t know her reasons and she sure as hell doesn&amp;#39;t know mine haha) but I actually DID decline and got a water instead.  It wasn&amp;#39;t a big thing at all but I am so fucking proud of myself for not having a drink-- normally I would find this to be the perfect excuse to cheat.  But dude, it&amp;#39;s DAY 2, I can&amp;#39;t do that to myself already!  I also haven&amp;#39;t smoked weed even though it is all RIGHT there and my partner is smoking tonight.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I just wanted to say that tonight, I feel a little hopeful.  I am proud of myself for doing the right things today.  I really hope that I can keep it up-- I really need to give this a real shot.  I&amp;#39;m so sick of feeling depressed.  I hope at least that the Abilify doesn&amp;#39;t make me sick or uncomfortable tonight!&lt;/p&gt;

I just want to have a good time…I miss home so much.. Any and all advice on how to deal with this is appreciated. I know I’m just going to have to wait until Monday to go home..I dunno what to do. Thanks for reading&lt;/p&gt;

I've been dealing with Anxiety and at one point Clinical Depression for a lot of my life. And a few years ago, I had a moment of actualization where I hated who I was and knew I had to change. So I spent a year examining what it was I hated about myself and another 2 years and continuing afterwards to actively try to change. I thought I had made so much progress with all the effort I had put forward.

And today I've relapsed back to square one.

For context, I did something I've felt guilt over back then. I prioritized a romantic interest over my best friends and made them feel discarded. I apologized afterwards, but during my self-analysis that was one of the main points I wanted to change most. To make sure my friends knew I cared about them and to not make them feel optional.

So I tried. I tried to keep more in contact, keep myself in check whenever I saw habits of leaving someone in the dark, etc. For anyone who relates, you know just how much effort that requires from someone who's fighting everyday by themselves already. For someone who naturally pushes people away because of the walls you put up. It was hard.

And today I found out I made the same friend feel the same way all over again. This time, prioritizing another friendship over ours. And I just...shutdown. I made the same mistake, the same scenario. Even with all the effort put forward.

It's selfish, I know. I hurt them, so why am I the one hurting right now? But I can't help it. I can't help but think that the last few years of effort were pointless. That I spent over 1000 days to just end up exactly where I started. And the worst part is? They don't even deny it. They know I'm still at that square. Some part of me, some selfish part, just wanted to hear that I did make progress. That I'm not the same person I was back then. That it was just a mistake or slip up that could happen from a miscommunication and that it's no big deal. But they didn't say that. They said to try a new approach. That I just need to be more aware. That I do a lot of things that irk them, but they let it pass because we've known each other for a long time.  That they forgive me.

That last part hurts the most. They forgive me. Again.

I'm just...so tired. Tired of everything really. Of trying. Of expecting things to be different on the next go. Of being forgiven.

So I have a friend, E that I've known since I was in elementary school. In 8th grade, her and her sister moved away and I didn't hear from them again for 6 years. I finally got to contact them after 6 years. Her sister wasn't interested in talking to me at all, despite her sister being the one who I hung out with the most. So me and E stayed friends pretty much, while her sister did her thing.

Fast forward nearly a year later. So everytime I've suggested or asked to meet up with E to finally see her 6 years later, she said it wouldn't work out because her foster parents don't want her hanging out with older people. I didn't really push it past that. So many months after we became friends again, her and her boyfriend broke up. My best friend then suggested I date E, which I kinda did consider but I still found the whole idea too weird to really do. My friend then proceeds to flirt with E, and they go from there. Aaaand they started talking about meeting up to hookup, etc. I'm starting to get really annoyed because I've literally known her my whole life and haven't seen her in years, and everytime I've asked to see her if was always some excuse of why she can't, but then when they want to meet up and hookup and all that, it's no problem as long as their sneaky about it.

 I got annoyed to the point I deleted the group chat. E and her friends noticed the reason why. Now, E is the type of person where, if she knows something bothers you, she will keep doing it infront of you to get a reaction. This is exactly what she kept on doing, even taunting me, saying she'll fuck my friends. I made sure not to show it this time, but it just got me more annoyed. Now shes on the phone waaaay later than she ever was with me with my friends, wanting to meet up, all that. Now I just feel like I've been completely replaced, like she doesn't even care for me anymore. Ontop of this, my friend has a girlfriend, yet he's still flirting and all that with E anyways. E knows he has a girlfriend, yet that doesn't seem to stop either of them anyways.

I’m in the late 30s now, and maybe worse than ever. Early this week I was admitted to a residential treatment program. I’ll be here for 30 days. I’m hopeful - it’s pretty intensive, 5 hours of therapy a day (a mix of individual and group) as well as other care - bloodwork, medication management with a physicist, and other things like yoga, mindfulness, learning coping skills, etc. So far it’s been good, but hard. Not that I didn’t expect that. 

It’s a strange feeling being here. I’m glad for the treatment, and for having the basics handled for me - meals, schedule, giving meds at the right time - things I was having a very hard time with on my own. This week is the first week in a year and a half that I have eaten more than one meal a day.  But there are constant reminders that I’m here because I can’t be trusted on my own. We’re supervised 24/7, all our belongings are searched - both upon arrival and randomly each day. We have to take a breathalyzer once a day, and there are random drug screenings (I came back to my room today after afternoon group with a cup on my sink for me to pee in. Fun!) Meds are handed out under supervision. Things like my razor have to be locked up, and checked out to use. It’s both comforting and humiliating. I am a grow-ass adult who has to be monitored like a toddler. 

I’d been using alcohol and weed to numb myself the last few months, and while my drinking was never (quantity-wise) a problem, the way I was using it definitely was, and having nothing to take that edge off is ROUGH. I’m glad I don’t have that crutch right now, but man what I wouldn’t give for one drink right now. Or to just get nice and baked. Best I can do right now is a cup of herbal tea and a walk around the yard. 

The thing is, what scares me most is that I’ll go home, and I’ll just go back to my miserable existence. And then I don’t know what I’ll do. Well I do. I can’t go through this again. It’s agony. It’s excruciating.  And if I don’t find relief, then I’m done. What if I’m beyond repair? In my first check in with my therapist here, she asked something to the effect of, why are you here? And I told her honestly that it feels like I have no choice. I’m at complete rock bottom and I don’t know what else to do. 

Life for me has been just a series of distractions to get from one day to the next. I have no purpose. I feel invisible. I could go on, but I’m sick of talking about how fucked up I am.

Years ago, the only thing keeping me alive was waiting for the finale of my favorite TV show. A year or so afterwards, I had my first suicide attempt.

It's funny cus not too long ago, I finally felt that the world was my oyster. I thought I built a great resume for my dream job and that I finally found a therapist who really cared and was on my side.

Here's what's keeping me alive lately, and I'm scared:

- Animal Crossing (video game)

- My Chihuahua is the only innocence left in the world.

- Once I'm able to quit my job (when?), I can self-medicate with weed and shrooms. (Fuck these antidepressants.)

- My home decorating is a WIP. I'm proud of what I've done so far and want to finish the vision.

What's killing me:

- The financial pressure. For the first time in my life, I'm experiencing financial security. I can't bear the thought of going back to where I was, no matter how unbearable it feels to work in this mental state.

- The daily pressures. Everything little demand makes me freeze or cry. I have PTSD from sexual abuse. Do you think anyone has ever given me a free pass for my suffering? Nope. Suck it up, buttercup, you have responsibilities (to others...)

- Nobody gives a shit. I'm a bleeding heart, I love to connect with people deeply. But I can't do that anymore because everyone just judges. People say they want to help, then say stupid shit, like ""first, you've gotta help yourself."" Ok, thanks, like I'm not already putting all the energy I have into NOT fucking exploding.

I have no friends; anything that I do is by myself and I have to find my own fun. If that doesn’t happen (which 99% of the time it doesn’t because no one asks me to do anything with them and their friends), I stay home and do things to keep myself busy.

I just can’t see how they would want to put up with that. 

It just doesn’t make sense to me why or how anyone would want to burden themselves with having to see me by their own will. I’m just tolerated in the times and places I need to be. ‘Just interact as much as you need to to satisfy him and get him to go away.’ To them, I think I’m just a nuisance.

I love it, it gets me out of the house and is super fun, or at least was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t able to play in person during the pandemic and playing on the computer just isnt the same, ao i was ecstatic when i got vaccinated and stores opened back up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But somethings wrong, losing isnt fun anymore. If i lose i feel defeated, drained. Im leaving events early when i can no longer win prizes. Even finishing the night at a 50% win rate makes me want to go home and put a shotgun in my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I dont even feel that bad besides magic. I got a new job, its going well, video games are fun, im generally happy. But the only thing I want to do during my nights is enjoy magic again and I cant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dont know how to fix it either. I tell myself you have to just stay positive, take the hits, dont let the loss get you down and have fun. But when the first loss of the night comes, boom, im down all night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I fix this? I know im not gonna get a new hobby, i dont want to, i need magic to just be fun again because i know it can be, like it was before.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been trying so hard to make a good impression on these people so that maybe I could actually make some friends for once, but now I’m getting the impression that they’re starting to either hate me or I annoy them.

I have Asbergers, so not only am I already awkward, but I lack any sort of common sense, so I tend to mess up a lot when it comes to the work I’ve been doing. I’ve been working here for like a month, and I feel like everyday I mess something up. I’ve been trying so hard to make a good impression on these people so that maybe I could actually make some friends for once, but now I’m getting the impression that they’re starting to either hate me or I annoy them.

I still have self-harm scars on my arms, but they have faded so much that they're barely noticeable, unless you look for them.

i guess in no means life has been easy on me. i've always had anxiety, even far back to grade school when i would have panic attacks about handing in school work and having to go in for tests and quizzes. i didn't know at the time that this stemmed from the abuse i endured from my brother. in fact, i just recently found out i was abused and have barely any recollection of what happened to me. i always knew my brother had anger problems, because that was basically all anyone in my family talked about. i did not know until recently how bad it was (hitting, name calling, screaming, etc). a little bit of backstory; currently i am 18, my brother is 27, and my sister is 30. i don't have many memories of when my brother lived with us (around 2 years ago) but i do know fighting was a very prevalent thing in my life. when my mother was younger she had my brother and sister with a different, abusive man that would mistreat my mother and brother in the same way my brother mistreated me. my brothers dad never wanted him, he wanted my mom to get an abortion as soon as he knew my mom conceived. my sister was favoured by him in a very clear way. later my mom remarried and had me, at this point my brother was already knee deep in past trauma and now developing heavy anger issues. when i was born my siblings both made some sort of pact to hate me (i get it, i bet if my parents got a divorce i'd hate the new baby too). but one day my brother got mad at me and slapped me in the back of the head my sister was done with it, they got in a gigantic fight and my sister has been in my corner ever since (i was probably 3-4, and of course my brother would never hit me in front of my parents). now my sister had been moved out for probably 5 years and my brother 2. i remember having a lot of trouble when my sister left and i think i was slightly depressed (can't really remember). i always had trouble going to school but after my sister left things doubled, i stopped going to school and even if i wanted to go back i'd get so anxious about people bombarding me with questions that i just stopped going completely. i was put in therapy for my anxiety and was also prescribed escitalopram, not knowing how much my brother was effecting me and everyone sweeping that under the table. my therapist was terrible and i stopped going after 5 months (we got nowhere, he would assign me worksheets ?? if i'm not even doing school why would he expect me to do them). recently i slept over at my brothers (but before i found out he abused me) and everything was fine until the next morning. him and his girlfriend got into a huge fight over her being cranky in the morning (it was nothing big) he threw something at the tv and he was calling her names and screaming. that's been bothering me for a long time, i felt like a child being screamed at even tho it wasn't me. in the last month he's gotten a dog that he blatantly abuses in front of everyone. i want to say something so bad but i'm so scared he'll do something really bad to it or his girlfriend if he gets really pissed. i feel like him being around me in general without this already brings back trauma and this dog on top of it just makes me want to steal the dog and be able to shelter it from him. i just wanna cry seeing how scared this dog is.

now i'm still on escitalopram (which i think is not working) and am addicted to weed. before i found out about my abuse i was using moderately and now that i've found out its gotten a lot worse, same with my mental health. all i do is cry if i'm sober. i used to feel so crazy for being depressed and having anxiety before i found out about anything, i felt that way on a regular basis and i still do sometimes. now i feel like i'm becoming a hypochondriac with searching shit up on google, terrible anxiety, recently discovered adhd, and just wanting to cry all the time. my mind jumps to the next anxiety multiple times in seconds, it feels like there's constantly 40 tabs open in my head and they're all just worries. on top of this i compulsively lie about my life for no reason. i feel extreme guilt for the things i tell people and have tried so hard to stop but i'll catch myself in the middle of a story making something up not even purposely. i think i make things up to get less judgement from the person, idk. i want to be an honest person and i really want to improve. i feel like a burden to everyone around me. i guess i need some advice, i know i need to go to therapy again but my last therapist makes me worry about a new one (i know i will end up going). sometimes i don't know if i'm crazy or just traumatized from what happened. i don't think i got enough guidance because everyone that was there wanted to protect me from him and that's what everyone focused on. i need some guidance and i know this is reddit but i've never opened up to anyone this much, so i guess it's a start.

growing up have always been despised society (even today) people looked at me they judged me, they made fun of me and bullied me. until 1 day i met a guy that was like me, i saw nothing bad in him so i supported him and until i was 15 i had already met a handful of society rejects like myself we became great friend until i first visited England. live in england was 100x better in every single way my parents asked me if i wanted to move and me being the altruistic person that i am said yes, loosing everything i got, i was a teenager and so were my friends, today they are big popular guys and im a forgotten memory, i guess its due to the fact that i grew up alone i became a very observant person so now when i go back to my country i can see and feel that im just bothering people.

my parents only care about money and work, my mother cried and was in pain because when we came to the uk she didnt have any friends in the first 6 months same with my father, i felt the same way but because im not them they constantly criticise me for feeling what they FELT. i want some time for myself but my parents dont understand that they want to see me earning money so that i can give them more and more money (their own words btw). to be honest i secretly never wanted to work when i was a kid i would tell people i wanted to be an engineer so that noone would judge me but i always wanted to be a ""adventurer"" :) when i was a kid, now i wanted to be a hippie like live outdoors, surviving from the wilderness but im here because that makes my parents disappointed.

Today im 21 have no job (not ashamed btw i think people should take time for themselves if they can), no friends, play video games/music to cheer myself up, stream to twitch hoping i'll meet people like me or someone who might enjoy being ""near"" me, live with my parents who are disappointed in me and constantly criticise me and my spoiled sister who is always fukin up and no one teaches her what consequences are, im tired of life, society, goverment, money, religion and politics, i have thought of killing myself but the thought that would hurt people like my sister, grandma and maybe mother i would rather suffer till the end of my life than hurt them.

Then don't ask the fucking question! 

So many people I left me in red after I have told them how I feel. Why ask the question if you didn't care about answer.! My so-called friends have turned their backs on me. And I knew them for 20 and 10yers. But that meant nothing apparently... 6 head surgeries in one year that was 5 years ago destroyed my life. I can only walk 700m 2 times a day I can't be in a large group of people. I wake up every morning feeling like shit. It literally feels like I have to climb Everest every day!! And I have people that have honestly told me to be happier. And they are the same people that complain over one year of being isolated. Try 5 fucking years!!!!! So don't tell me what to do when you are weaker! If I'm unlucky my life I destroyed forever. And that I never can manage a full-time job. 

One year after my surgery I did rehabilitation and studied up my Grades. I got top top grades and improved my condition at the same time. So I'm weak? Yeah fucking right. It took me 2,5 years to do it but I got it done! Went from walking 70m once a day to 500m 2 times a day 

Then when I wanted to try rehabilitation and University on 50% distance. I almost did one course. But I had to fight with the system at the same time. So I got a big backlash. Thank you society. So now I go in my walk and spend the rest of my time in bed. 

I will probably get a lot of hate for this but it can't be worse than being rejected 100 times. ( probably more I have lost count)

I need to talk about dating as an ish ugly and depressed man with health problems. My experiences with dating haven't been good. I have been rejected, block, and ignored more than I can remember. All I hear is what's wrong with me. It has gotten to the point that I now believe them... Anxiety and loneness are a part of my daily life. 
Something that is really provocative is when girls say “good boys don't exist” and I'm over here like “ yes we do but I was apparently too ugly and boring for you” I'm not going to lie I had 7 months when I wasn't lonely. I meet my first girlfriend and finally lost my virginity. The problem was that she was toxic. So I had to leave that relationship. But apparently, I was good for her because I was her first. And 2 months later she found a new one. So I did something right. The reason why she was bad for me was that she started a lot of fights and when she got upset she said some really horrible things just to put me down. When I broke up she said some nasty stuff. Now once did I say anything bad back. I even had other people reading it and I asked them If I did or say something wrong. And trust me dose people would tell me if I did something wrong. Even if that was difficult I don't regret anything. Now 2 years later I'm back to being rejected so a part of me thinks that I should have stayed. My therapist doesn't agree. 😂 

So why doesn't a man who never would take his partner for granted, be there for her when she needs you ( even after me breaking up yes I didn't ignore all here messages I answered even too all the really mean stuff) I will give you a few reasons. 1 I'm not “cool or macho” 2 I'm short 3 I don't look good 4 I'm not confident 5 I have health issues 6 I'm depressed. There we go I have given you some reasons 😂 you might say that you don't want a macho man. But if we look back to school growing up. Who got all the girls?  One thing for sure it wasn't me. What I have realized after talking to A LOT of people is the a lot of girls want a bad boy that they can turn good. My only hope is to find the few who just want a good boy. And yes I know that you girls exist. The only problem with you is that you 99% of the time already have found the love of your life. And to put a disclaimer out I'm not hating on girls I just tell you why I feel the way I do. And trust me I know I'm far from perfect. But I will be there for you 24/7 even if I have mad anxiety, I will never take you for granted and I will tell you regularly that you are my light in this dark tunnel and that I'm so lucky to have you. You might wonder how I am when I'm really depressed. What I probably will say is that you deserve someone better than me. The girl that can handle that is an angle. Thank you for reading my rant. I hope that you will get through whatever you are battling and I wish you the best. Damn I just realized that I haven't told you about my health issues. I already have a post about it I will link it. Thank you.

people are fucking bullshit! it's like you try to make connections and then your forgotten, misunderstood, etc. better off being alone than to bother making yourself vulnerable to other people.

sorry for ranting....i only have one friend that cares enough about me. everyone else is just fucking terrible. one last night is too busy being all positively lecturing, the other one damn near forgets my birthday and hasn't bothered to fucking text me in a long while.

It's been a hard 8 months for me. It started when my husband and I had communication problems that turned our relationship into a complete misunderstanding. I separated from my husband (I'm also a guy if that matters) who was definitely not right for me and I've regretted it ever since. I feel like I fucked up and I can never go back to being happy...

He has told me he is over the relationship  with me and his bf is younger, fitter, and more of a positive person than I am. I just found out today that some of my good friends, who haven't been in touch with me for months, have been hanging out with my ex and his bf. I've been asking these friends to hang out for at least a month or two and got subtle signs they weren't interested, like not replying or avoiding the question, but I didn't think anything of it at the time... It's heartbreaking... I've known these people for 10 years.

I feel like depression has made me into nothing more than a negative and bitter person who is obsessed with negativity. I think those friends avoid me because I'm negative so often and it fucking sucks. I try to ask for support sparingly from many of my friends so I don't overwhelm anyone with my negativity. I thought I was doing okay with that but apparently not... But I tried so hard... forced myself to be positive sometimes. I wanted them to have a good time with me. I was a good friend to those ppl, was on time, contributed to conversation, pulled my weight in the friendship, or so I thought...

I'm confused because I want to be able to act like myself and feel sad and not hide it, and accept this and be kind and patient with myself as I try to heal, but part of that means telling my friends how i feel and if these people think I'm negative (and more than one person has said this about me) then I feel like I have to hide myself and I don't have the energy to do that anymore. I'm scared to tell some of my other friends about my problems because I don't wanna overwhelm them... I don't wanna hide who I am...

Maybe I should just be alone... I think that's how I'll end up anyway and it's hard to accept and I'm afraid and angry. I feel like I've failed if I have to be alone... And my ex has won... Even though he treated me terribly during our relationship.

It's just been one thing after the other... breakup, job problems, roomate problems, friends not talking to me, family ignoring me, been too lazy to go outside so my mood gets worse and worse... So I feel like all areas of my life have deteriorated to the point where I can't fix or heal... It's just too much. I need a break from this hell.

**ONE: Just breathe (Saturday)**

   Honestly, what gave me the idea to cut myself, it's a question I always asked myself. Maybe it was my emotionally abusive family or my realization that it is scientifically proven that I am attractive. If you're wondering why I said that, it’s because I'm a mouth breather. I breathe through my mouth which means my face is literally flat and my chin has a weird-shaped Adam’s apple simply because I breathe differently. I sleep in the same room as my parents, and as you can guess it isn't exactly the best atmosphere. I wish I had my own room, so I wouldn't have to smell the sweat on hot days. The room has a light in the middle with a little bowl covering it, I was cleaning my bed a long time ago and slapped it with my blanket and broke the bowl and the light. A piece of both of them fell on my bed and every time I turn the light on I’m afraid I'll breathe in carbon monoxide, I probably am.

   I live in a two-bedroom apartment in park hill Colorado, and literally, everything is broken. The linear light bulb in the kitchen flickers and makes a weird buzzing sound. The kitchen floor tiles are torn apart and if I walk in there barefoot I could feel the glue or whatever on the floor. The porch is fine but the electrical box has a broken panel and if anything a rat could climb and turn off the power, which is probably what happens when we lose power every week. The living room is big, I don't know why we call it the living room if the atmosphere is dead, and so is something else under the floor, creating a rotten flesh smell. It isn't a human’s dead body, at least I don't think it is, a few months ago we heard meows of a cat in the basement, we went outside to open the basement and waited 10 hours for the cat to leave when we thought it did we closed the hole to the basement. A few days later we heard it again and left it alone, if it was gonna keep getting trapped in there what’s the point. The door to my room is also broken, my dad broke it down when I locked myself in after an argument. I guess my sister’s room isn't broken, I need to take a breath, I’m aggravated about the place we live but I just need to be grateful instead of being toxic and annoying.

**TWO: Cold (Monday)**

  The cat in my basement must be seeking warmth, it was snowing a lot recently but I shouldn't be surprised since the weather here is bipolar. Poor thing must've been so cold. I asked my mom, ""Do you think it’s still down there?"" She replied, ""Do you smell the rotting corpse?"" To be honest, I didn't expect such a dark reply, she was always kind and honest but after this, my perspective seemed to change, I held her in admiration, I expected her to be my role model, and wouldn't you know it-i'm disappointed. I've become isolated because of her actions, I was unable to make friends and any friends I did make apparently ""sold drugs"" according to her. I wouldn't have space or necessarily any sense of freedom. 

  Maybe she’s just being a mom and trying to protect me but it really isn't helping. I feel as if she doesn't want me to grow up, my father could care less what I did, and I don't know whether or not to be disappointed in him or not. He doesn't seem like he knows what he’s doing, neither of them does in all honesty but I can't blame them. Both are from Mexico so this technology and language in the U.S are very different, my moms’ grandpa was shot to death by police for a domestic violence report made by my Uncle. I can't really get into details since I only ever got a vague briefing on it, but essentially what I can assume is that life didn't treat my mom well either. After this realization a few months ago, I felt like an asshole, cold-hearted and mean for being so heartless.

**THREE: Suffocate (Tuesday)**

 What a bore life is, it’s always gonna be the same thing, you wake up, brush your teeth, go to school or work until you get out, eat, shower then sleep. As a 9th grader, I really shouldn't be focusing on stuff like that, or be paying attention to it but I can't help but notice that there isn't anything interesting. That’s probably why people drink alcohol and do drugs, not to numb pain-or maybe that and to kill time. Me for one, cannot get drunk or high. Anytime I try I fail, it feels as if it’s because I’m conscious, I’m aware that I'm drinking and doing drugs. 

 Have you ever had that moment in which you feel as if you're suffocating? That’s how I feel about life, some would say a drowning sensation but to me, it feels as if I’m overwhelmed by responsibilities I don't even have yet. There is one thing that distracts me though- love. Not that anyone has ever liked me because they haven't. I'm just fascinated by the concept, although some would say it’s just a chemical reaction, how is it possible that you can ""love someone"" when all it is, is a chemical reaction that makes you wanna create babies, but at the same time you can feel physically attracted to someone else. How? That’s a mystery that hasn't been solved yet and unlike my unattractive face I don't care whether or not this has been scientifically proven to be a chemical reaction, there has to be a reason.

**FOUR: Alright (Wednesday, Thursday)**

I'm too focused on that, whatever the hell love is I’ll have a definition for it eventually but right now, in this moment, I'm alright, and the more I tell myself that the more I actually start to believe it. Still doesn't change the fact that I wanna kill myself so badly. Maybe I should actually start reaching out for help instead of a knife. If I actually wanted to kill myself why haven't I done it already? The next morning I went to the school counselor and we spoke about what the possible cause of my depression might be, I really can't be saying it’s depression because I'm undiagnosed but what else am I supposed to call it? Crazy? 

 ""Have you had any past trauma? Emotional? Physical?""

""Well maybe emotional since I really don't know, my mom is overprotective and that really hurts especially if all I wanna do is grow up""

 ""What about physical?""

""No""

 ""Any other trauma I should know about?""

""Well actually maybe both emotional and physical but not because of my family, I had a friend named Mandy she had dyed hair, one side was black and the other side was white, I don't really know what to call her since she wasn't my girlfriend but we started having sex. Eventually, I fell in love with her but never had the chance to tell her since she left without warning, maybe her family forced her to leave after they caught us in her room""

 ""Why wasn't she at your house?""

""My mom doesn't allow me to have sex, she doesn't even know of Mandy, no one in my family does. I could have brought her over but we wouldn't have been able to do anything since my mom had a rule that I had to have my door open if I brought home a girl. And for the second time, I and my parents have the same room""

 ""Okay-now are you making this up?""

""No-wait why would I be-""

 ""Okay, okay I was just making sure, anyway I think it’s time we end our session""

""Oh, so do I just leave?""

  ""Yes""

""Can I at least get a pass?""

Alright, never doing that again.

**FIVE: Trapdoor (Thursday)**

I walk to class contemplating whatever the hell just happened, I reached out for help and the next thing I know I'm being asked whether or not I made it up. As I enter the class, a bully named Daniel attempts to trip me.

 ""What up redneck! Wanna come to my party on Saturday?""

I stare at him but ignore, a trivial point that he made and in all honesty the name calling makes sense but at the same time it doesn't. I have a birthmark on my neck, they said it'd go away in a few weeks but I’ve had it my whole life. Typically someone would associate a redneck as a white racist with a red hat. But for my classmates, its whoever has a hickey or birthmark on their neck. They never take into consideration my Latino heritage, even when I speak Spanish. I can't blame them, their stupid, extremely stupid actually, and I can't just call myself smart without sounding egotistical but that’s what it is.

I have the biggest ego knowing that they think they’re the shit, some of them are in gangs and some pretend to be in gangs. They walk around the school acting all tough, and I can't disagree, their impenetrable bags of meat and are as dumb as I am smart. 

 ""What-you gonna snitch bro?""

""What is your problem, why are you talking to me?""

 ""I'm just asking if you're gonna snitch pussy!""

""No, I’m not, because I could literally care less about what you think, that is if you can, you don't exist in my eyes, and the only time I ever notice you are when you're being an asshole, and that’s the only thing anyone will ever remember you by""

 ""If you don't care, why'd you respond?""

Why did I respond, I haven't really ever stood up for myself before and I didn't care about the party, I've come to the realization that I’ve probably made the situation much worse. Can't help but feel as if my generation, gen-z, is falling through a trapdoor.

**SIX: Crazy (Friday)**

 I'm crazy for thinking like this but in the end, I know it doesn't matter. Any crime I commit, any person I yell at or any great achievement is pointless and I can't stress it enough. It seems to be overlooked and not talked about, that’s why people like me don't have many or any friends. I can't change, it doesn't bother me but it bothers others. I'm better at convincing myself that life sucks without even trying, but can't do the same thing for happiness. I know what you're thinking, ""Why are you crying over a dumb girl dumping you? You realize that there’s people in the cold because they’re homeless and they can't afford food. You have it the best!"" I am aware of these things and I'm sorry if I come off as an asshole, but I really can't simulate the feeling of hopelessness they feel. I'm not them and unfortunately, everyone feels differently about different things so I can't sympathize but I know it sucks ass for them. This is how I feel on a daily basis and it gets worse at night. I don't really have a reason to be depressed, its what I think, and its what the school counselor thought. For what its worth, it might be that I'm crazy, I might be making it up

**SEVEN: Blue (Saturday)**

 Took a loop at the park today, I was bored of being inside the house doing absolutely nothing. Saw the most beautiful person, she had short black hair, an oversized cyan-colored hoodie with navy pants.

 ""What’s up,"" I said as I walked by her

""Hey""

That voice sounds familiar.

   ""Do I know you?""

""Well- you spoke to me first I was just replying""

  ""No, I was just wondering because your voice sounded familiar""

My accent makes me say ""because"" weird, I drag on the ""ca"". 

""I get that a lot- are you flirting with me?""

 ""No- well I thought about it but I genuinely feel like I know you""

""I'm just fucking with you! It’s me, Kimberly""

Kimberly, its been 4 years since she left, she used to be my best friend back in 5th grade, the last memory I have of her is a text on my dads old phone. It was an android emoji with a picture of her family above it, I received it during a quinceanera but never replied.

 ""Holy shit! Why'd you leave the school?""

""I never left, we literally graduated together, I'm still going to school""

 ""Okay makes sense, how’s it been?""

""What school or me in general?""

 ""You""

""I'm fine, I’ve been outta touch with people from our old school, other than the ones who go to Darlin with me, what about you? Have you been in contact with anyone?""

 Searching for any way to answer this question, I don't have friends or attempt to message anyone, so my answer should be no, but I'm here with her.

 ""No, n-no one other than you"" I stuttered

 What the hell is this? Why is she here, does she live near?

 ""Why is the sky blue?"" She asks randomly

**EIGHT: Nevermind (Saturday/Sunday)**

""Uh, I have to go phones vibrating probably my mom calling, bye""

 ""Alright bye!"" She yells from a distance as I run away

 What was that, did she read my mind and hear me ask all those questions?

 ""¿Omar, Dónde estabas?""

""El parque""

 ""Espero que no estés vendiendo drogas""

I'm not gonna argue with her about the same thing over and over again, anytime I wander off to do my own thing she has to assume I’m selling drugs for fucking someone.

 ""Mijo!"" She yells

""Que!""

 ""We're moving on Monday, you get to have your own room but we have to you move schools, I’m sorry you'll have to say goodbye to your friends""

 ""I don't have any anyway, where are we headed?""

""Highlands ranch""

 ""That’s in the mountains, what about grandma?""

""She's fine with it mijo, now go to sleep we have to start packing tomorrow and you'll have to wake up early""

 ""It’s 6 p.m though""

""We wake up at 4 a.m""

  ""Oh""

My alarm scared me, it was set to 3 a.m instead of 4 a.m and I might as well start packing early, I don't really have much anyway. I have 5 shirts, 5 pairs of pants, 5 pairs of socks and one pair of shoes. Anytime I go to Grarnar high school I rotated whatever I wore. My lack of clothes is what granted us the ability to buy a house in the mountains. But then again everything far from Denver is cheaper since is farther from downtown. Everyone wants to live there and I don't blame them, its actually an extremely small city with a lot of traffic but it still opens up a lot of opportunities. I remember staying up at night watching people on the snap map on Snapchat partying downtown. It looked alive, I wish I was down there but right now we are unable to afford anything. 

 ""Mijo come here and help me take my stuff outside"" mom called

""When did you wake up? I woke up at three and i'm still not finished""

 ""Around 2 a.m, I couldn't sleep because of the neighbors""

""Que hicieron ellos?""

 ""We sleep next to their bedroom, take the fattest guess""

Her accent was able to make that seem innocent but at least recently she’s been speaking more English, not that I hate if she speaks Spanish but I myself am not fluent in Spanish, I don't know big words. Ever since I went to school I've been fluent in English more than my first language, it’s terrifying. Kimberly calls and asks why I ran away yesterday, nevermind, guess she doesn't have superpowers.

**NINE: The Viper (Monday/day)**

The day has arrived! I'm so excited I forgot to pack my toothbrush. How were my school grades gonna get transferred over, I’ve been in that school for more than half a year? Doesn't matter, new people and a clean slate. 

 ""Take your shit of the trunk"" father said

""I don't have anything in the trunk""

 ""Then who's clothes would be bright? Tus hermanas no visten colores brillantes""

That's true they don't wear bright colors, my youngest sister wears all black, my second youngest wears brown and white, and my oldest sister wears whatever the hell she can find. This is unusual, i'll just throw it in the trash.

 ""What the fuck!"" my dad exclaimed

""Dijiste que no era la ropa de mi hermana""

 ""Its not, its yours! Lo compré como un regalo tonto""

A bright yellow raincoat, in spring with dandelions, spread all across the grass. Laying on the flowers with my new raincoat, I realize there are more than just dandelions. Roses, Lavander, a white flower that I’ve never seen before. Green grass and an old broken down stone building next to our house. It was brown with a front porch and an oak door with a small shed next to it. It had an upstairs window peering into the driveway. 

 ""Omar!"" I hear across the street

""Kimberly? What are you doing here?! Did you follow me?""

 ""No, I live near here""

""So why were you at Parkhill?""

 ""I was visiting family but got into an argument with my step-dad, you wanna come over""

""Uh, sure let me unpack first""

I'm not gonna question anything instead I'm gonna question everything, I didn't know how to react because it felt like she pulled a ""visiting family"" excuse card. Hopping a fence to get over to Kimberly was probably the worst idea I've had yet, feels like I've got a splinter in my leg now.

 ""What was the argument about?""

""Why does it matter? Mind your business"" Kimberly yells

 ""Shit my bad, I just thought that if you were visiting they'd try and defend you""

""My entire family hates you, not your family, just you-they don't want me talking to you""

 ""So why are you talking to me?!""

""Why am I talking to boys? I'm lesbian, my parents just don't want me hanging around boys because they think I’ll fall in love for something, don't ask me to ask them""

 ""Why'd you say me like I was special, should've just said males, boys, guys. Why is this even a problem?""

""Why the fuck are you asking so many questions?""

 ""The party, held at Daniels house on Saturday""

""Shut up Omar""

 ""What did he do to you?""

""Nothing, can we hurry? It’s about to rain""

We scurry to the back of Kim’s house.

 ""Kimberly!!"" We hear from the inside

""Oh shit my step-dad's inside, uh go to the left side and there's a window I’ll open it for you""

The window wasn't really a window it was a glass door in the shape of a circle that she decided to call a window or maybe it was a window but to me, it’s just a door. She slams the window. Her room is a light purple, maybe Lavander colored, does she like Lavander. She has a nightstand with a mirror, and añl over the nightstand is makeup. The floor is covered in dirty clothes and spiffs are hidden in the pockets of her hoodie. The rain starts to pick up.

 ""Kim! Where the fuck are you? Get me a goddamn beer"" echos through the hall as footsteps get closer

""Get yourself a beer you're already up and walking!""

 ""Should've responded the first time shit head- who the fuck is this?""

  ""Uh, I'm Omar""

""No shit! You're that guy from like four to three years ago that had a crush on Kim- wait why the fuck are you here!""

 ""Dad calm down""

""Don't tell me to calm down wet bitch, you ran off to a party and now you invited this little shit into our house? Who do you think you are? I'm the adult here not you.""

 ""I'm myself asshole, I'm lesbian I'm not planning on doing anything with him""

He laughs

""Just like you said last time""

He hits her

""HEY!"" I yell loudly

He punches me in the stomach

""You walk into my house, with my daughter, and enter her room!""

 ""She is not even your real daughter dumbass""

""She is still family""

 ""Then why did you hit, her""

I kick his balls and run out of the house carrying Kimberly.

""Thank you,"" she says winded

 ""Your step-dads a real asshole, a snake beneath the surface""

""No one says that""

 ""Well I did""

**TEN: Moonlight (Monday/Night)**

The dirt is wet and I'm wearing Vans running away from a crazy lunatic carrying his step-daughter. What a day it’s been, its barely 6 p.m and it's already night. 

 ""Omar""

""What's up""

 ""Why'd you move?""

""I guess I was just able to""

 ""Did you miss me?""

""Uh, is this a rhetorical question?""

 ""You liked me and I left""

""Oh that, it didn't bother me and if anything it helped me get over you quicker, and you don't just ask someone that without it sounding awkward and cringey; can you walk?""

 ""No""

""When can you walk""

 ""Why?""

""Because""

 ""Omar""

""I'm tired""

She gets out of my arms and starts walking.

 ""Why did you carry me in the first place, he slapped my cheek he didn't shoot my leg with a shotgun""

""Oh, that’s true""

 ""You just wanted to carry me didn't you?""

""Shut the fuck up with that no I didn't, and if i did then oops my bad it was internal, I'ma say it now because you're acting suspicious""

 ""Suspicious?""

""I don't like you, Kimberly, not anymore, you're a friend. I carried you because I was full of adrenaline or something. You say your lesbian but keep teasing me. When I saw you on Saturday yeah I thought you were hot until I found out it was you""

 ""Ouch, sensitive much? I'll stop if it means you stop whining""

""Deal""

 ""Where are we?""

We are standing in the middle of a field of tall grass with no buildings in sight and the stars aren't visible only the moonlight. Why does that happen? Somedays at night the stars are entirely visible and the next their not. It’s like they don't wanna be perfect, but they’re supposed to be. 

**ELEVEN: Downstairs (Tuesday)**

We had to sleep under a rock near a creek, I think it was a hiking trail because I could see a bench not too far across the river.

 ""Kim wake up""

""Hm, what, why""

 ""I think I know how to get home""

""You're not taking me back there""

 ""No, I'm not, I wasn't planning to you're gonna stay at my house""

 ""Where would I sleep?""

""My room or downstairs on the couch""

 ""The couch""

""I was gonna tell you to pick that anyway""

 ""How do we get home?

""You see that bench behind the birch moss tree? I think its a hiking trail and we can just follow it either way because they would both be an exit""

 We start the long journey home, on the way my phone finally got service and we started taking pictures. I took a picture of Kim standing on the bench. She took a picture of me standing on two rocks in the creek with my yellow raincoat. We arrive at my house with my parents nowhere to be found and sisters at work or school. I grab Kim some of my sister’s clothes' and grabbed one of my warm blankets since I sleep with three. I handed her my old sleeping bag that I didn't get to use and my dinosaur pillow. 

 ""Can you give me a tour?"" She asks

""Uh, I haven't been in here longer than ten minutes so I'm as clueless as you""

We explore each room, each time getting amazed by the fact that my entire house is the same color as her room, Lavander. I and my family haven't really bought furniture and all we have is a table with metal chairs and a nightstand in each room. The house has 4 rooms and my room is the best because it has a tiled roof with a window. I brought a poster about a video game to make my room feel more full. 

 ""What's in the shed?"" Kim asks

""I have no idea, maybe my dad’s tools he works in construction""

 ""Where are the keys?""

""Probably on the key hanger by the door, a bad idea to have it by the entrance but here we are. Why are you asking questions now""

She grabs the keys and heads outside to the shed, I follow and hear noises coming from it. She turns the key and then turns the knob revealing- geese. There are geese in my shed.

 ""Is this legal""

""Uh, I don't know, don't tell anyone and if you do they were in there before we moved here""

 ""Do they have names""

""Can you actually talk everything you've said so far is a question? No, they don't, because I didn't even know they were here, and now you can't name them""

 ""Why? Why? What? Why?""

""Okay well, I'm going back upstairs""

 ""So am I""

""No, you aren't, you stay downstairs""

 ""The only bathroom is upstairs though""

""Okay fine""

She walks upstairs with me and enters the bathroom. It smells like burning, maybe my mom is home cooking. Never mind, she’s not in the kitchen. It’s coming from upstairs, from the bathroom.

 ""Kimberly, are you fucking smoking in the bathroom?""

""Yeah""

 ""Oh..uh..can I join""

""Let me enter your room""

 ""Fine""

She enters my room with 3 blunts and a lighter.

 ""Why didn't you use your lighter to create fire back in the rain?""

""My lighters always break when I use them in the rain""

Looking at the clock I realize a lot of time has gone by, I look out the window to reassure myself, and sure enough, the sun is rising. 

 ""Holy shit! It’s three a.m you gotta go downstairs and sleep""

""Wait why?""

 ""We haven't slept much at all these last two days and I don't want you to die, please go downstairs""

""Alright, fine""

**TWELVE: Your escape (Wednesday)**

The next morning I heard my parents laughing downstairs, I haven't told them about Kimberly so I hope they don't freak out 

 ""Omar, no nos hablaste de tu novia"" exclaims my mother

 ""Girlfriend?"" I and Kim say at the same time

""Mom No es así, su padrastro era un imbécil y no creo que ella estuviera segura allí""

 ""You're even protecting her,"" my older sister says as she enters the house.

""Goddammit, I'm going outside""

 ""No you're going to school,"" my dad says shaking his keys

""School? What school?""

 ""Darlin Highschool""

""That’s my school too"" Kim blurted

 ""I'll take you both"" dad insisted

""Why are all of you calm about Kim being here?"" I laughed

""She gonna live here until-""

 ""Live? You don't get to decide that Omar"" Kim shouted

""Okay, you're right, she'll STAY here until she feels comfortable leaving""

 ""Guess I'm leaving right now""

""Wait Kimberly- that’s not what I meant""

She exits the house and starting hopping the fence.

 ""You better chase her, if her step-dad really is an asshole you have to protect her"" my youngest sister declared

I sprint out the door and jump over the fence

""KIMBERLY"" I shouted

 ""WHAT?"" She snapped

 ""Why do you have to care about me? You say you don't like me yet treat me nicely what is your problem.""

""Kim, I'm sorry""

 ""Kiss me""

""What? I thought you were lesbian""

 ""Guess I'm bisexual now, kiss me""

I kiss her on the cheek.

 ""Kimberly, come back, I want you to be safe""

She wraps her arms around me and drags me to the ground.

""Kimberly-""

She starts making out with me near her house, I can't help but admit that I liked it. 

""Do you, wanna go to my room?"" I asked

""Yeah"" she agreed

We go back to the fence and hop it, run towards my house and burst through the door, head upstairs, and enter my room. She kisses my lips as I caress her thighs. I slide my hands up and down her body taking off her panties and bra. 

 ""Omar, I love you,"" she says with excitement

""Why?"" I asked confused

 ""You're my escape from reality""

""I'm your escape?"" 

**THIRTEEN: People (Still Wednesday)**

""Yeah""

My father bursts down the door

 ""I knew she was your girlfriend!"" He yells as he closes the door as quickly as he opened it.

""Goddammit we still have to go to school"" I exclaim

We get dressed and go downstairs.

 ""Y'all ready?"" Dad laughs

""Get the fuck in the car"" I shout

Why would my father open the door knowing he heard us? I'm starting to hate him bit by bit. But the truth is I hate people in general. No one likes a straightforward answer, it always has to be complicated for it to make sense. People exchange numbers and socials to later never text or call, but just to observe. Everything is centered around dating and I don't want my story to be about romance. I'm going to break up with Kim, I know I just got with her but I have to.

During our lunch period, my plan is to be direct with her. No extra time, It’s now or never or I’ll never escape.

The bell rings and it’s time for lunch, walking over to Kim I notice water on the window, is it raining again?  I walk over to her table

“Hey Kim, I have to tell you something”

“What’s up?”

“I think we should break up - now I don’t think our relationship is bad in any way, and I know we just got together but I think it’s best for both of us to separate”

This was a good idea, we moved too fast, faster than light if anything. Why’d I take up this responsibility? I sat there not wanting any then took the hardest quest on the board. She’s not my problem, and she shouldn’t be. She’s an entirely different species I almost have no experience with. 

*Last chapter incoming****: Sunday is when Stratus clouds form potholes, and in one minute they can cocoon you. All your phantoms will return, memories, the good ones at least, and fireworks will explode in the sky as flames fall down they will light the pines and burn the bad ones.*** 

**FOURTEEN: On the Fourth of July (Sunday)**

I can summarize life in a pretty short way. We live we die. We build memories, from parents forcing their ideals onto us and hoping that we’ll become what they want us to. Then there are those born without any, which I cannot speak for. But we choose our own path and become stronger in spite of bad memories. I like music, I could totally become an artist but I’m not really good at anything. If I see an opportunity I should take it, be it a good friend or a girl that likes me. But at the same time, I have every right to assume there’s a catch. Life is too short to risk anything and this will fly under people’s radar but it’s true. I or you could die any moment, we don’t know. That’s what depresses me I guess. I wanna live, I wanna die, but I’m already gonna die? So why not live? It’s a paradox and maybe in the end I was never depressed. I don’t know what it’s like to struggle, I have a bed, shelter, family, I couldn’t ask for more. I myself don’t know anymore and I seek validation. You people tell me that I just have too much self-awareness, and yeah, maybe that is the issue. The biggest issue of all is that self-reflection that makes you overthink when self-aware.

I dont know if I made the right choice or not, but it really wouldn’t matter because it results wouldnt even change if I did or didn’t give up. I’m alone, fat, ugly, ungrateful, I shouldn’t exist and I should’ve never been born. An In-patient facility didn’t help, I was offered therapy but didn’t take that either because it was online, and either way I don’t think it would have been able to help me. I’ve seen so many things I want to remember, I find beauty in nature and vibes and cultures, I love art and music. Nice people, mean people, old people. Stars in the sky, planets I want to visit. But I’m lost and confused, I’m afraid of growing up and I keep and falling into these spirals, each one getting deeper and taking me for a loop. Really wanting to teach me that history repeats itself. I do the same things, make the same mistakes, it’s a cycle.- I wanna go to Japan, see a light festival, go to India and eat food, I wanna explore every building go to every party. Things. Dammit. I wanna do THINGS! I wanna LIVE I wanna be alive! I dont really have a destination and I’ll down all the pills I have to feel better, I’ll fill my contacts with suicide hotlines. I’ll count the time on the clock, I’ll work out, I’ll eat healthily, I won’t be mean or do anything bad to my health. I won’t ever cut myself again. I’ll form as many memories as I can, I’ll take as many pictures as my phone can hold. I’ll find a treasure, find true love, I’ll even have a family. I’ll be the best father even though most fathers are usually bad. I wanna drink every drink, explore every sewer, I wanna time travel, and watch all marvel movies and shows before the world ends. I’ll stand still for 12 months, I’ll watch snow fall and rain. I’ll watch plants grow. I’ll make music, starting with an acoustic song, might name it slushie based on a memory I had with a cute girl under a bridge at night, her lips were green because of her slushie.  Now, I am not gonna offer advice, and I can't make any promises I can't keep since I cannot help. I am here because i wanna know what you guys think? Its an obvious answer. Am I depressed?  (this post might get taken down my mods for breaking one of the rules, Idk which one because I think im following all of them, but yeah)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ONE: Just breathe (Saturday)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, what gave me the idea to cut myself, it&amp;#39;s a question I always asked myself. Maybe it was my emotionally abusive family or my realization that it is scientifically proven that I am attractive. If you&amp;#39;re wondering why I said that, it’s because I&amp;#39;m a mouth breather. I breathe through my mouth which means my face is literally flat and my chin has a weird-shaped Adam’s apple simply because I breathe differently. I sleep in the same room as my parents, and as you can guess it isn&amp;#39;t exactly the best atmosphere. I wish I had my own room, so I wouldn&amp;#39;t have to smell the sweat on hot days. The room has a light in the middle with a little bowl covering it, I was cleaning my bed a long time ago and slapped it with my blanket and broke the bowl and the light. A piece of both of them fell on my bed and every time I turn the light on I’m afraid I&amp;#39;ll breathe in carbon monoxide, I probably am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in a two-bedroom apartment in park hill Colorado, and literally, everything is broken. The linear light bulb in the kitchen flickers and makes a weird buzzing sound. The kitchen floor tiles are torn apart and if I walk in there barefoot I could feel the glue or whatever on the floor. The porch is fine but the electrical box has a broken panel and if anything a rat could climb and turn off the power, which is probably what happens when we lose power every week. The living room is big, I don&amp;#39;t know why we call it the living room if the atmosphere is dead, and so is something else under the floor, creating a rotten flesh smell. It isn&amp;#39;t a human’s dead body, at least I don&amp;#39;t think it is, a few months ago we heard meows of a cat in the basement, we went outside to open the basement and waited 10 hours for the cat to leave when we thought it did we closed the hole to the basement. A few days later we heard it again and left it alone, if it was gonna keep getting trapped in there what’s the point. The door to my room is also broken, my dad broke it down when I locked myself in after an argument. I guess my sister’s room isn&amp;#39;t broken, I need to take a breath, I’m aggravated about the place we live but I just need to be grateful instead of being toxic and annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TWO: Cold (Monday)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cat in my basement must be seeking warmth, it was snowing a lot recently but I shouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised since the weather here is bipolar. Poor thing must&amp;#39;ve been so cold. I asked my mom, &amp;quot;Do you think it’s still down there?&amp;quot; She replied, &amp;quot;Do you smell the rotting corpse?&amp;quot; To be honest, I didn&amp;#39;t expect such a dark reply, she was always kind and honest but after this, my perspective seemed to change, I held her in admiration, I expected her to be my role model, and wouldn&amp;#39;t you know it-i&amp;#39;m disappointed. I&amp;#39;ve become isolated because of her actions, I was unable to make friends and any friends I did make apparently &amp;quot;sold drugs&amp;quot; according to her. I wouldn&amp;#39;t have space or necessarily any sense of freedom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe she’s just being a mom and trying to protect me but it really isn&amp;#39;t helping. I feel as if she doesn&amp;#39;t want me to grow up, my father could care less what I did, and I don&amp;#39;t know whether or not to be disappointed in him or not. He doesn&amp;#39;t seem like he knows what he’s doing, neither of them does in all honesty but I can&amp;#39;t blame them. Both are from Mexico so this technology and language in the U.S are very different, my moms’ grandpa was shot to death by police for a domestic violence report made by my Uncle. I can&amp;#39;t really get into details since I only ever got a vague briefing on it, but essentially what I can assume is that life didn&amp;#39;t treat my mom well either. After this realization a few months ago, I felt like an asshole, cold-hearted and mean for being so heartless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THREE: Suffocate (Tuesday)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a bore life is, it’s always gonna be the same thing, you wake up, brush your teeth, go to school or work until you get out, eat, shower then sleep. As a 9th grader, I really shouldn&amp;#39;t be focusing on stuff like that, or be paying attention to it but I can&amp;#39;t help but notice that there isn&amp;#39;t anything interesting. That’s probably why people drink alcohol and do drugs, not to numb pain-or maybe that and to kill time. Me for one, cannot get drunk or high. Anytime I try I fail, it feels as if it’s because I’m conscious, I’m aware that I&amp;#39;m drinking and doing drugs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had that moment in which you feel as if you&amp;#39;re suffocating? That’s how I feel about life, some would say a drowning sensation but to me, it feels as if I’m overwhelmed by responsibilities I don&amp;#39;t even have yet. There is one thing that distracts me though- love. Not that anyone has ever liked me because they haven&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;m just fascinated by the concept, although some would say it’s just a chemical reaction, how is it possible that you can &amp;quot;love someone&amp;quot; when all it is, is a chemical reaction that makes you wanna create babies, but at the same time you can feel physically attracted to someone else. How? That’s a mystery that hasn&amp;#39;t been solved yet and unlike my unattractive face I don&amp;#39;t care whether or not this has been scientifically proven to be a chemical reaction, there has to be a reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOUR: Alright (Wednesday, Thursday)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m too focused on that, whatever the hell love is I’ll have a definition for it eventually but right now, in this moment, I&amp;#39;m alright, and the more I tell myself that the more I actually start to believe it. Still doesn&amp;#39;t change the fact that I wanna kill myself so badly. Maybe I should actually start reaching out for help instead of a knife. If I actually wanted to kill myself why haven&amp;#39;t I done it already? The next morning I went to the school counselor and we spoke about what the possible cause of my depression might be, I really can&amp;#39;t be saying it’s depression because I&amp;#39;m undiagnosed but what else am I supposed to call it? Crazy? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Have you had any past trauma? Emotional? Physical?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well maybe emotional since I really don&amp;#39;t know, my mom is overprotective and that really hurts especially if all I wanna do is grow up&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What about physical?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Any other trauma I should know about?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well actually maybe both emotional and physical but not because of my family, I had a friend named Mandy she had dyed hair, one side was black and the other side was white, I don&amp;#39;t really know what to call her since she wasn&amp;#39;t my girlfriend but we started having sex. Eventually, I fell in love with her but never had the chance to tell her since she left without warning, maybe her family forced her to leave after they caught us in her room&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why wasn&amp;#39;t she at your house?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My mom doesn&amp;#39;t allow me to have sex, she doesn&amp;#39;t even know of Mandy, no one in my family does. I could have brought her over but we wouldn&amp;#39;t have been able to do anything since my mom had a rule that I had to have my door open if I brought home a girl. And for the second time, I and my parents have the same room&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Okay-now are you making this up?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No-wait why would I be-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Okay, okay I was just making sure, anyway I think it’s time we end our session&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, so do I just leave?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can I at least get a pass?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, never doing that again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIVE: Trapdoor (Thursday)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walk to class contemplating whatever the hell just happened, I reached out for help and the next thing I know I&amp;#39;m being asked whether or not I made it up. As I enter the class, a bully named Daniel attempts to trip me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What up redneck! Wanna come to my party on Saturday?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stare at him but ignore, a trivial point that he made and in all honesty the name calling makes sense but at the same time it doesn&amp;#39;t. I have a birthmark on my neck, they said it&amp;#39;d go away in a few weeks but I’ve had it my whole life. Typically someone would associate a redneck as a white racist with a red hat. But for my classmates, its whoever has a hickey or birthmark on their neck. They never take into consideration my Latino heritage, even when I speak Spanish. I can&amp;#39;t blame them, their stupid, extremely stupid actually, and I can&amp;#39;t just call myself smart without sounding egotistical but that’s what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the biggest ego knowing that they think they’re the shit, some of them are in gangs and some pretend to be in gangs. They walk around the school acting all tough, and I can&amp;#39;t disagree, their impenetrable bags of meat and are as dumb as I am smart. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What-you gonna snitch bro?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What is your problem, why are you talking to me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m just asking if you&amp;#39;re gonna snitch pussy!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, I’m not, because I could literally care less about what you think, that is if you can, you don&amp;#39;t exist in my eyes, and the only time I ever notice you are when you&amp;#39;re being an asshole, and that’s the only thing anyone will ever remember you by&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you don&amp;#39;t care, why&amp;#39;d you respond?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did I respond, I haven&amp;#39;t really ever stood up for myself before and I didn&amp;#39;t care about the party, I&amp;#39;ve come to the realization that I’ve probably made the situation much worse. Can&amp;#39;t help but feel as if my generation, gen-z, is falling through a trapdoor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIX: Crazy (Friday)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m crazy for thinking like this but in the end, I know it doesn&amp;#39;t matter. Any crime I commit, any person I yell at or any great achievement is pointless and I can&amp;#39;t stress it enough. It seems to be overlooked and not talked about, that’s why people like me don&amp;#39;t have many or any friends. I can&amp;#39;t change, it doesn&amp;#39;t bother me but it bothers others. I&amp;#39;m better at convincing myself that life sucks without even trying, but can&amp;#39;t do the same thing for happiness. I know what you&amp;#39;re thinking, &amp;quot;Why are you crying over a dumb girl dumping you? You realize that there’s people in the cold because they’re homeless and they can&amp;#39;t afford food. You have it the best!&amp;quot; I am aware of these things and I&amp;#39;m sorry if I come off as an asshole, but I really can&amp;#39;t simulate the feeling of hopelessness they feel. I&amp;#39;m not them and unfortunately, everyone feels differently about different things so I can&amp;#39;t sympathize but I know it sucks ass for them. This is how I feel on a daily basis and it gets worse at night. I don&amp;#39;t really have a reason to be depressed, its what I think, and its what the school counselor thought. For what its worth, it might be that I&amp;#39;m crazy, I might be making it up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEVEN: Blue (Saturday)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Took a loop at the park today, I was bored of being inside the house doing absolutely nothing. Saw the most beautiful person, she had short black hair, an oversized cyan-colored hoodie with navy pants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What’s up,&amp;quot; I said as I walked by her&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That voice sounds familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do I know you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well- you spoke to me first I was just replying&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, I was just wondering because your voice sounded familiar&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My accent makes me say &amp;quot;because&amp;quot; weird, I drag on the &amp;quot;ca&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I get that a lot- are you flirting with me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No- well I thought about it but I genuinely feel like I know you&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m just fucking with you! It’s me, Kimberly&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kimberly, its been 4 years since she left, she used to be my best friend back in 5th grade, the last memory I have of her is a text on my dads old phone. It was an android emoji with a picture of her family above it, I received it during a quinceanera but never replied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Holy shit! Why&amp;#39;d you leave the school?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I never left, we literally graduated together, I&amp;#39;m still going to school&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Okay makes sense, how’s it been?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What school or me in general?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m fine, I’ve been outta touch with people from our old school, other than the ones who go to Darlin with me, what about you? Have you been in contact with anyone?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Searching for any way to answer this question, I don&amp;#39;t have friends or attempt to message anyone, so my answer should be no, but I&amp;#39;m here with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, n-no one other than you&amp;quot; I stuttered&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the hell is this? Why is she here, does she live near?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why is the sky blue?&amp;quot; She asks randomly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EIGHT: Nevermind (Saturday/Sunday)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Uh, I have to go phones vibrating probably my mom calling, bye&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alright bye!&amp;quot; She yells from a distance as I run away&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was that, did she read my mind and hear me ask all those questions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;¿Omar, Dónde estabas?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;El parque&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Espero que no estés vendiendo drogas&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not gonna argue with her about the same thing over and over again, anytime I wander off to do my own thing she has to assume I’m selling drugs for fucking someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mijo!&amp;quot; She yells&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Que!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re moving on Monday, you get to have your own room but we have to you move schools, I’m sorry you&amp;#39;ll have to say goodbye to your friends&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t have any anyway, where are we headed?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Highlands ranch&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That’s in the mountains, what about grandma?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She&amp;#39;s fine with it mijo, now go to sleep we have to start packing tomorrow and you&amp;#39;ll have to wake up early&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It’s 6 p.m though&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We wake up at 4 a.m&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My alarm scared me, it was set to 3 a.m instead of 4 a.m and I might as well start packing early, I don&amp;#39;t really have much anyway. I have 5 shirts, 5 pairs of pants, 5 pairs of socks and one pair of shoes. Anytime I go to Grarnar high school I rotated whatever I wore. My lack of clothes is what granted us the ability to buy a house in the mountains. But then again everything far from Denver is cheaper since is farther from downtown. Everyone wants to live there and I don&amp;#39;t blame them, its actually an extremely small city with a lot of traffic but it still opens up a lot of opportunities. I remember staying up at night watching people on the snap map on Snapchat partying downtown. It looked alive, I wish I was down there but right now we are unable to afford anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mijo come here and help me take my stuff outside&amp;quot; mom called&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When did you wake up? I woke up at three and i&amp;#39;m still not finished&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Around 2 a.m, I couldn&amp;#39;t sleep because of the neighbors&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Que hicieron ellos?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We sleep next to their bedroom, take the fattest guess&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her accent was able to make that seem innocent but at least recently she’s been speaking more English, not that I hate if she speaks Spanish but I myself am not fluent in Spanish, I don&amp;#39;t know big words. Ever since I went to school I&amp;#39;ve been fluent in English more than my first language, it’s terrifying. Kimberly calls and asks why I ran away yesterday, nevermind, guess she doesn&amp;#39;t have superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NINE: The Viper (Monday/day)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day has arrived! I&amp;#39;m so excited I forgot to pack my toothbrush. How were my school grades gonna get transferred over, I’ve been in that school for more than half a year? Doesn&amp;#39;t matter, new people and a clean slate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Take your shit of the trunk&amp;quot; father said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t have anything in the trunk&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then who&amp;#39;s clothes would be bright? Tus hermanas no visten colores brillantes&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s true they don&amp;#39;t wear bright colors, my youngest sister wears all black, my second youngest wears brown and white, and my oldest sister wears whatever the hell she can find. This is unusual, i&amp;#39;ll just throw it in the trash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What the fuck!&amp;quot; my dad exclaimed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dijiste que no era la ropa de mi hermana&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Its not, its yours! Lo compré como un regalo tonto&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bright yellow raincoat, in spring with dandelions, spread all across the grass. Laying on the flowers with my new raincoat, I realize there are more than just dandelions. Roses, Lavander, a white flower that I’ve never seen before. Green grass and an old broken down stone building next to our house. It was brown with a front porch and an oak door with a small shed next to it. It had an upstairs window peering into the driveway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Omar!&amp;quot; I hear across the street&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kimberly? What are you doing here?! Did you follow me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, I live near here&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So why were you at Parkhill?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I was visiting family but got into an argument with my step-dad, you wanna come over&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Uh, sure let me unpack first&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not gonna question anything instead I&amp;#39;m gonna question everything, I didn&amp;#39;t know how to react because it felt like she pulled a &amp;quot;visiting family&amp;quot; excuse card. Hopping a fence to get over to Kimberly was probably the worst idea I&amp;#39;ve had yet, feels like I&amp;#39;ve got a splinter in my leg now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What was the argument about?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why does it matter? Mind your business&amp;quot; Kimberly yells&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shit my bad, I just thought that if you were visiting they&amp;#39;d try and defend you&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My entire family hates you, not your family, just you-they don&amp;#39;t want me talking to you&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So why are you talking to me?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why am I talking to boys? I&amp;#39;m lesbian, my parents just don&amp;#39;t want me hanging around boys because they think I’ll fall in love for something, don&amp;#39;t ask me to ask them&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why&amp;#39;d you say me like I was special, should&amp;#39;ve just said males, boys, guys. Why is this even a problem?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why the fuck are you asking so many questions?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The party, held at Daniels house on Saturday&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shut up Omar&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What did he do to you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nothing, can we hurry? It’s about to rain&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We scurry to the back of Kim’s house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kimberly!!&amp;quot; We hear from the inside&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh shit my step-dad&amp;#39;s inside, uh go to the left side and there&amp;#39;s a window I’ll open it for you&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The window wasn&amp;#39;t really a window it was a glass door in the shape of a circle that she decided to call a window or maybe it was a window but to me, it’s just a door. She slams the window. Her room is a light purple, maybe Lavander colored, does she like Lavander. She has a nightstand with a mirror, and añl over the nightstand is makeup. The floor is covered in dirty clothes and spiffs are hidden in the pockets of her hoodie. The rain starts to pick up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kim! Where the fuck are you? Get me a goddamn beer&amp;quot; echos through the hall as footsteps get closer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Get yourself a beer you&amp;#39;re already up and walking!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Should&amp;#39;ve responded the first time shit head- who the fuck is this?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Uh, I&amp;#39;m Omar&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No shit! You&amp;#39;re that guy from like four to three years ago that had a crush on Kim- wait why the fuck are you here!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dad calm down&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t tell me to calm down wet bitch, you ran off to a party and now you invited this little shit into our house? Who do you think you are? I&amp;#39;m the adult here not you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m myself asshole, I&amp;#39;m lesbian I&amp;#39;m not planning on doing anything with him&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He laughs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Just like you said last time&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He hits her&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;HEY!&amp;quot; I yell loudly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He punches me in the stomach&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You walk into my house, with my daughter, and enter her room!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She is not even your real daughter dumbass&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She is still family&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then why did you hit, her&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kick his balls and run out of the house carrying Kimberly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thank you,&amp;quot; she says winded&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Your step-dads a real asshole, a snake beneath the surface&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No one says that&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well I did&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEN: Moonlight (Monday/Night)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dirt is wet and I&amp;#39;m wearing Vans running away from a crazy lunatic carrying his step-daughter. What a day it’s been, its barely 6 p.m and it&amp;#39;s already night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Omar&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s up&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why&amp;#39;d you move?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I guess I was just able to&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Did you miss me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Uh, is this a rhetorical question?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You liked me and I left&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh that, it didn&amp;#39;t bother me and if anything it helped me get over you quicker, and you don&amp;#39;t just ask someone that without it sounding awkward and cringey; can you walk?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When can you walk&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Because&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Omar&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m tired&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She gets out of my arms and starts walking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why did you carry me in the first place, he slapped my cheek he didn&amp;#39;t shoot my leg with a shotgun&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, that’s true&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You just wanted to carry me didn&amp;#39;t you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shut the fuck up with that no I didn&amp;#39;t, and if i did then oops my bad it was internal, I&amp;#39;ma say it now because you&amp;#39;re acting suspicious&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Suspicious?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t like you, Kimberly, not anymore, you&amp;#39;re a friend. I carried you because I was full of adrenaline or something. You say your lesbian but keep teasing me. When I saw you on Saturday yeah I thought you were hot until I found out it was you&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ouch, sensitive much? I&amp;#39;ll stop if it means you stop whining&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Deal&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Where are we?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are standing in the middle of a field of tall grass with no buildings in sight and the stars aren&amp;#39;t visible only the moonlight. Why does that happen? Somedays at night the stars are entirely visible and the next their not. It’s like they don&amp;#39;t wanna be perfect, but they’re supposed to be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ELEVEN: Downstairs (Tuesday)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had to sleep under a rock near a creek, I think it was a hiking trail because I could see a bench not too far across the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kim wake up&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hm, what, why&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I think I know how to get home&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not taking me back there&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, I&amp;#39;m not, I wasn&amp;#39;t planning to you&amp;#39;re gonna stay at my house&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Where would I sleep?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My room or downstairs on the couch&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The couch&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I was gonna tell you to pick that anyway&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How do we get home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You see that bench behind the birch moss tree? I think its a hiking trail and we can just follow it either way because they would both be an exit&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start the long journey home, on the way my phone finally got service and we started taking pictures. I took a picture of Kim standing on the bench. She took a picture of me standing on two rocks in the creek with my yellow raincoat. We arrive at my house with my parents nowhere to be found and sisters at work or school. I grab Kim some of my sister’s clothes&amp;#39; and grabbed one of my warm blankets since I sleep with three. I handed her my old sleeping bag that I didn&amp;#39;t get to use and my dinosaur pillow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can you give me a tour?&amp;quot; She asks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Uh, I haven&amp;#39;t been in here longer than ten minutes so I&amp;#39;m as clueless as you&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We explore each room, each time getting amazed by the fact that my entire house is the same color as her room, Lavander. I and my family haven&amp;#39;t really bought furniture and all we have is a table with metal chairs and a nightstand in each room. The house has 4 rooms and my room is the best because it has a tiled roof with a window. I brought a poster about a video game to make my room feel more full. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s in the shed?&amp;quot; Kim asks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have no idea, maybe my dad’s tools he works in construction&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Where are the keys?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Probably on the key hanger by the door, a bad idea to have it by the entrance but here we are. Why are you asking questions now&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She grabs the keys and heads outside to the shed, I follow and hear noises coming from it. She turns the key and then turns the knob revealing- geese. There are geese in my shed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is this legal&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Uh, I don&amp;#39;t know, don&amp;#39;t tell anyone and if you do they were in there before we moved here&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do they have names&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can you actually talk everything you&amp;#39;ve said so far is a question? No, they don&amp;#39;t, because I didn&amp;#39;t even know they were here, and now you can&amp;#39;t name them&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why? Why? What? Why?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Okay well, I&amp;#39;m going back upstairs&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So am I&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, you aren&amp;#39;t, you stay downstairs&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The only bathroom is upstairs though&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Okay fine&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She walks upstairs with me and enters the bathroom. It smells like burning, maybe my mom is home cooking. Never mind, she’s not in the kitchen. It’s coming from upstairs, from the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kimberly, are you fucking smoking in the bathroom?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh..uh..can I join&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Let me enter your room&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fine&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She enters my room with 3 blunts and a lighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why didn&amp;#39;t you use your lighter to create fire back in the rain?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My lighters always break when I use them in the rain&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the clock I realize a lot of time has gone by, I look out the window to reassure myself, and sure enough, the sun is rising. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Holy shit! It’s three a.m you gotta go downstairs and sleep&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait why?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We haven&amp;#39;t slept much at all these last two days and I don&amp;#39;t want you to die, please go downstairs&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alright, fine&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TWELVE: Your escape (Wednesday)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning I heard my parents laughing downstairs, I haven&amp;#39;t told them about Kimberly so I hope they don&amp;#39;t freak out &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Omar, no nos hablaste de tu novia&amp;quot; exclaims my mother&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Girlfriend?&amp;quot; I and Kim say at the same time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mom No es así, su padrastro era un imbécil y no creo que ella estuviera segura allí&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re even protecting her,&amp;quot; my older sister says as she enters the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Goddammit, I&amp;#39;m going outside&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No you&amp;#39;re going to school,&amp;quot; my dad says shaking his keys&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;School? What school?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Darlin Highschool&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That’s my school too&amp;quot; Kim blurted&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll take you both&amp;quot; dad insisted&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why are all of you calm about Kim being here?&amp;quot; I laughed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She gonna live here until-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Live? You don&amp;#39;t get to decide that Omar&amp;quot; Kim shouted&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Okay, you&amp;#39;re right, she&amp;#39;ll STAY here until she feels comfortable leaving&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Guess I&amp;#39;m leaving right now&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait Kimberly- that’s not what I meant&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She exits the house and starting hopping the fence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You better chase her, if her step-dad really is an asshole you have to protect her&amp;quot; my youngest sister declared&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sprint out the door and jump over the fence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;KIMBERLY&amp;quot; I shouted&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;WHAT?&amp;quot; She snapped&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why do you have to care about me? You say you don&amp;#39;t like me yet treat me nicely what is your problem.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kim, I&amp;#39;m sorry&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kiss me&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What? I thought you were lesbian&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Guess I&amp;#39;m bisexual now, kiss me&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kiss her on the cheek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kimberly, come back, I want you to be safe&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wraps her arms around me and drags me to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kimberly-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She starts making out with me near her house, I can&amp;#39;t help but admit that I liked it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do you, wanna go to my room?&amp;quot; I asked&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah&amp;quot; she agreed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We go back to the fence and hop it, run towards my house and burst through the door, head upstairs, and enter my room. She kisses my lips as I caress her thighs. I slide my hands up and down her body taking off her panties and bra. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Omar, I love you,&amp;quot; she says with excitement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot; I asked confused&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re my escape from reality&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m your escape?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THIRTEEN: People (Still Wednesday)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father bursts down the door&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I knew she was your girlfriend!&amp;quot; He yells as he closes the door as quickly as he opened it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Goddammit we still have to go to school&amp;quot; I exclaim&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get dressed and go downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Y&amp;#39;all ready?&amp;quot; Dad laughs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Get the fuck in the car&amp;quot; I shout&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would my father open the door knowing he heard us? I&amp;#39;m starting to hate him bit by bit. But the truth is I hate people in general. No one likes a straightforward answer, it always has to be complicated for it to make sense. People exchange numbers and socials to later never text or call, but just to observe. Everything is centered around dating and I don&amp;#39;t want my story to be about romance. I&amp;#39;m going to break up with Kim, I know I just got with her but I have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our lunch period, my plan is to be direct with her. No extra time, It’s now or never or I’ll never escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bell rings and it’s time for lunch, walking over to Kim I notice water on the window, is it raining again?  I walk over to her table&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey Kim, I have to tell you something”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What’s up?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think we should break up - now I don’t think our relationship is bad in any way, and I know we just got together but I think it’s best for both of us to separate”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a good idea, we moved too fast, faster than light if anything. Why’d I take up this responsibility? I sat there not wanting any then took the hardest quest on the board. She’s not my problem, and she shouldn’t be. She’s an entirely different species I almost have no experience with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last chapter incoming&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Sunday is when Stratus clouds form potholes, and in one minute they can cocoon you. All your phantoms will return, memories, the good ones at least, and fireworks will explode in the sky as flames fall down they will light the pines and burn the bad ones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOURTEEN: On the Fourth of July (Sunday)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can summarize life in a pretty short way. We live we die. We build memories, from parents forcing their ideals onto us and hoping that we’ll become what they want us to. Then there are those born without any, which I cannot speak for. But we choose our own path and become stronger in spite of bad memories. I like music, I could totally become an artist but I’m not really good at anything. If I see an opportunity I should take it, be it a good friend or a girl that likes me. But at the same time, I have every right to assume there’s a catch. Life is too short to risk anything and this will fly under people’s radar but it’s true. I or you could die any moment, we don’t know. That’s what depresses me I guess. I wanna live, I wanna die, but I’m already gonna die? So why not live? It’s a paradox and maybe in the end I was never depressed. I don’t know what it’s like to struggle, I have a bed, shelter, family, I couldn’t ask for more. I myself don’t know anymore and I seek validation. You people tell me that I just have too much self-awareness, and yeah, maybe that is the issue. The biggest issue of all is that self-reflection that makes you overthink when self-aware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dont know if I made the right choice or not, but it really wouldn’t matter because it results wouldnt even change if I did or didn’t give up. I’m alone, fat, ugly, ungrateful, I shouldn’t exist and I should’ve never been born. An In-patient facility didn’t help, I was offered therapy but didn’t take that either because it was online, and either way I don’t think it would have been able to help me. I’ve seen so many things I want to remember, I find beauty in nature and vibes and cultures, I love art and music. Nice people, mean people, old people. Stars in the sky, planets I want to visit. But I’m lost and confused, I’m afraid of growing up and I keep and falling into these spirals, each one getting deeper and taking me for a loop. Really wanting to teach me that history repeats itself. I do the same things, make the same mistakes, it’s a cycle.- I wanna go to Japan, see a light festival, go to India and eat food, I wanna explore every building go to every party. Things. Dammit. I wanna do THINGS! I wanna LIVE I wanna be alive! I dont really have a destination and I’ll down all the pills I have to feel better, I’ll fill my contacts with suicide hotlines. I’ll count the time on the clock, I’ll work out, I’ll eat healthily, I won’t be mean or do anything bad to my health. I won’t ever cut myself again. I’ll form as many memories as I can, I’ll take as many pictures as my phone can hold. I’ll find a treasure, find true love, I’ll even have a family. I’ll be the best father even though most fathers are usually bad. I wanna drink every drink, explore every sewer, I wanna time travel, and watch all marvel movies and shows before the world ends. I’ll stand still for 12 months, I’ll watch snow fall and rain. I’ll watch plants grow. I’ll make music, starting with an acoustic song, might name it slushie based on a memory I had with a cute girl under a bridge at night, her lips were green because of her slushie.  Now, I am not gonna offer advice, and I can&amp;#39;t make any promises I can&amp;#39;t keep since I cannot help. I am here because i wanna know what you guys think? Its an obvious answer. Am I depressed?  (this post might get taken down my mods for breaking one of the rules, Idk which one because I think im following all of them, but yeah)&lt;/p&gt;

I'm not entirely sure whether the sheer lack of interests and hobbies I've been into is because of the  raging pandemic and the need to shield others, if not myself from this thing- or if it's because I'm genuinely disinterested in doing anything else other than constantly being on my computer and looking for a job.

I haven't been to any mental health- related specialist, support group, or whatever. I constantly feel like I'm a shame of this family, society, planet. I can't be arsed to have a hobby, interest, anything active to do.

Seeking out help is genuinely something I never even expected I'd do, but I keep thinking all this, I keep being tearful and shaky, exhausted after a very short conversation with a stranger in the grocery store. Denial doesn't work, I guess.

I really just don't understand because I feel that I'm still in the same place but the ups are more up and the downs are more down. I still would rather not be here than deal with the ups and downs. It also seems that as I become more functional, my sadness and helplessness has turned to rage and anger. I envision myself just randomly hurting myself because I want to.

I still would rather not be here than deal with the ups and downs. It also seems that as I become more functional, my sadness and helplessness has turned to rage and anger. I envision myself just randomly hurting myself because I want to. Most likely because I somehow deserve it. And it would feel like a relief. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway... I just was wondering if anyone else experiences that. And also that is going to be okay because it feels like it&amp;#39;s not today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

(generally i sleep at 2 and wake up at 7 for school) and I started studying from 10 till around 1:45, had lunch attended class from 2 till 9 and then i had to do my basic exercising and bathing and then finally sitting down for homework and self study and clearly im quite busy, and then i had my dad come scolding me for like 45 mins straight for not doing chores, (i dont do them on friday) and the thing is, he's always like this, he doesn't care how busy you are or whay important stuff your doing, if he asks you to do something he expects you to drop everything and come do it right away. In the scenario you don't, you'll either get hit or scolded until u can't even breathe. And it's the last year of school so i have to yknow do extra circulars, courses and voulenterring etcetc and build up your applications and whenever I try to go talk to him about it he just dismisses me and tells me to go away and stop bothering him and thats fine i guess, I can figure it out msyelf as well and when i finally ask him to go out and do something he never allows. He's barely let me go out in 2 years. He keeos saying its because of corona but he himself goes to office everyday? I'm literally suffocated at home. I try to talk to him to let me out but he just locked me up in my room the whole day, and my mom cant help me either, we're all too afraid of him. I ask him for help to figure out what i want to do after school, how to build up a resume, how to look for internships but he just tells me to shut up and go away.  He cares alot about his work and his coworkers, if any of them need money he'll be the first to give but when it comes to my education, im wasting his time and money apprently. oh did i mention the fact that he wished i was a guy? yeah thats there too. he just wants me to stay at home and be a maid and manage only my studies and somehow get into a top college, its not that hes concerned about my studies either nono he wants me to *not* study and be a topper and get into a really good college so he can brag about it. He says I've dissaipointed him because i have to spend so much time studying and still don't manage to get full marks in everything (i end up losing 1-3 marks due to nervousness and i take alot of time to study since stuff doesn't go easily into my head) and moreover im a fat child so he's embarrassed to take me out as well. Maybe that's why he doesn't let me go out haha relevation. I asked him about gym so many times but he just says im too fat to go there so that's that. I was looking forward to escaping once i start college but he wants me to go to a online one. He's just a very manipulative, abusive and such a controlling bastard, I'm barely hanging on.

&amp;#x200B;

I just really need to vent a bit or otherwise I'm going to blow up. Life just really fucking sucks. You can never get out of your self and I'm the one making my life unliveable.

 I ghost everyone because for some reason I'm terrified of responding to messages, I'm dropping out of uni after failing a year already and I really can't stand my shit it anymore. I know I overthink and there's was to diminish anxiety over time but I'm too exhausted to continue. 

It's either be alone and wallow in fear, distress and self hate or be with others and put on a mask, get too scared to speak to others and see how far behind I am. I'm acutely aware of how self-centred this is, truly, but what the fuck! I've spent my life building the illusion that it gets better but if really doesn't (or at least I can't see the silver lining from where I'm standing).

 The only cope I've found is browsing and I'm falling into echo chambers. There's so much suffering and I can't do shit about any of it because all I have energy to do is to try and get through the day. I fucking quit everything I do, tried going to AA meetings but panicked after they started to get to know me and quit. I'm just dead weight at this point, causing stress for everyone around me.

I'm so TIRED of not trusting myself and disappointing everyone, being jealous of others and just not having anything together. I can't get close to anyone, I don't have enough self esteem...

Anyways, I just want to scream into the void for bitter release, but that's never going to come is it?

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you all are getting by out there, a day at a time if needed, but what the heeellllllll the only thing keeping me sane r now is Monty Python. Thank god for the french waiter video

I am new to reddit, however I am not new to depression.

I have literally been diagnosed with a few pink F-1/2x diagnoses (psychotropic behavior) and was taking every single possible pill for a few years (anti depressants, mood killers, etc)

Let me start by saying this:

IT IS NOT BAD TO SEEK HELP IF YOU ARE SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION! No, I am not talking about ""opening"" up to friends/family that most likely will make you a clown and either call you an attention seeking person or just pat you by the back and tell you that it's just a ""period"" and it will pass.

  
IT WILL NOT PASS!!! IT WILL NOT PASS UNLESS YOU TREAT IT!

Don't care what the society will think if you visit a therapist or take pills that will help you heal/pass that stadium in life. It's dark, trust me I know it is dark, I've been literally living in my own shit for months not CARING how I look, what I wear, what I eat or how I smell. 

That's what depression slowly does to you - it kills the purpose to live that every human being should have.

Stay safe friends and always do what is best for you, no matter what the public will think.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: If you suffer from a depression, visit/talk to a professional, not a friend or someone from your family as they will either underestimate the condition you are in or just give shit advises that won't help.

Apologies if this is unstructured and confusing. I've been writing this post for 4 months but I got so triggered last night and cut myself, I'm desperate for advice, so I thought I'd just merge all of the information together. I've tried to be vague and leave out details about the source because I'm so ashamed of it. As well as a direction and advice, I'm interested to know what people can make of this and if I deserve to complain about my feelings. I feel lonely and I'll never get to talk about the source of these feelings in any more detail than this post on an anonymous account.

It's not the type of fear anyone can empathize with or understand. If I had a fear this bad but of someone being killed, taken advantage of, those are understandably disturbing thoughts, even the idea of not happening to me but someone else, you would be able to sympathise with me. But comparing my fears to something reasonable like fear of someone dying is giving me too much credit. If I was to speak about the specifics, you'll unconsciously think ""I'm glad I'm not like that"" which is why I have to keep this so vague. I can't take these feelings seriously so imagine how impossible it is for someone without all this context. These feelings of grief or heartbreak (if they're the right words) started with a fictional character I didn't like who I would uncontrollably think about, and that isn't even the unusual part. At first glance, my feelings are stupid and unreasonable which is true, but it's a lot more complicated than that, with layers and some contradictions. I was perfectly fine, then gradually over two and a half years, my negative feelings have gone from a fictional character, to a type of fictional character, to a few real people, to pretty much anyone and now I fking hate the world I'm in and the people I'm stuck with. I hate the way people are the way they talk. I can't respect what people do to satisfy themselves and each other. My stomach and heart aches, It's difficult to think about anything else, my mind is on a group of random people. Trying not to distract myself from anything because it takes a lot of concentration to do this much mental gymnastics and denying. My only temporary escape is to write in this post, and even now I find myself stopping just to rethink over and over and reanalyse everything they said, what was hopefully exaggerated, what was figurative, what was literal, just from a YouTube comment of someone giving their life story, that I found 3 months ago for example. When I've posted before, I get asked if had a concussion, spiritual awakening, repressed memories, but I honestly have no explanation. I used to be terrified of a very different trope when I was very young up to my teenage years. I guess that's similar but it only scared me, it doesn't hurt me like this. Other than that, I've had a healthy childhood, not lost anyone close to me, never been abused, maybe a little emotional abuse, my parents are very sensitive too. I currently have no friends, crippling social anxiety, and I'm lonely but that seems like another less important issue that won't solve anything

Let's call this fictional character ""1"". I may have gone into unnecessary detail explaining this fake person so here's a TL;DR: A character in a show made me slightly uncomfortable, it gradually built up and I was thinking about 1 all the time, I became a fan of the show as a defence mechanism that keeps backfiring. The same thing happened to another character in the same show and they both equally discomforted me so I never looked at the show again. The next year, the fear became less bearable and I developed negative feelings for 8 other fictional and not fictional people.

If person reading this can figure out the show I'm describing, I'd prefer you to tell me without naming any names. In November 2018 I watched a TV show because I was bored. There was a scene focused on a character and the dialogue didn't sit right with me and I felt a very brief feeling of discomfort before I immediately forgot about it. This was the type of forgettable character that I found too bland to even form an opinion of at the time. I knew that I'd forget about this character's existence as soon as I stopped watching the show which was true for about 4 months, then I got very subconscious flashbacks, that were too subtle to acknowledge, I just felt a few little discomforting vague memories randomly. Around March, I decided to watch the rest of the first season, pretending no weird feelings were happening. As 1 showed up, I was trying to remove these feelings. It was a sympathetic situation so I told myself to feel sympathy which made me do fine for the rest of the season. Up to this point, everything I was thinking was pretty much subconscious. Now that I finished I went back and watched the scene with the dialogue I didn't like, now that I thought I was over it and nothing changed, I just felt bad again. Although I knew I was having weird feelings, I hadn't acknowledged yet that this was actually a thing. This entirely new emotion made no sense to me. I felt overwhelmed and sad but not at all like crying. Just to add to the confusion of that feeling, it was about a made up person who I didn't even know the name of. Further adding to the confusion I never heard of anyone being this sad over such a specific thing in fiction or real life. Most people get upset about death or breakups. I can't say when this exactly began within November to March but this was the moment I consider the start. I started to think about these feelings with words and I told myself something along the lines of ""this needs to go away, I'm feeling bad because of a fictional character"". I know now that I shouldn't patiently waited for time to pass and none of this would have happened but I didn't know that and my only solution was to find whatever I needed in the rest of the show which mostly backfired but occasionally helped. These bad feelings drew me into the show and into becoming a fan for a number of reasons. I was a fan because it was proof that I wasn't feeling bad, so in denial in a way. Within the five months I was a fan, I bought the video game adaptation and the sequel books even though I don't read. Maybe this is irrelevant but I like physical instead of digital, and I needed these products to be physical I guess because it's physical proof on the shelf that I'm ok with this show and character and I felt a bit proud of myself when they were delivered. The time it took for it to ship to my house was the most I'd ever been excited for a video game because I thought it was going to fix the problem and it had every reason to. custom characters and building relationships with the characters of the show, which was perfect because I could essentially interact with this person semi-canonically as an accurate depiction of myself so I could pretty much talk to this person I was having trouble with literally. The game doesn't take itself as seriously as the show which I found comforting at the time. I believe the opposite happened where instead of taking it less seriously because of the goofiness, it proved to me that I'll take anything seriously no matter how goofy something is. I even considered getting one of those funko figures even though I don't collect those and I'm not really a fan of collecting overpriced merch. But I think this is significant that I even considered having this character in my house when now I'm genuinely offended that a cute collectable of this character even exists. I thought about this character a lot deliberately too. If I was ever uncontrollably feeling bad about the character and specific events, I'd twist it into a direction I was more comfortable with involving the character as a cope. Mostly I'd just talk and ask questions in person which is really sad but it helped and I came up with about 10 drawn out scenarios. After a few weeks, I realised that the game didn't work, as well as I thought, so I decided to watch the next few seasons. I don't like pirating but I justified it because I needed every bit of redeemable content I could find and the little information I had was promising. I remember thinking to myself, it would be good if the same thing happened with another character in the same show to take my mind off 1 which coincidentally happened and didn't make me feel any better. The ""2"" feelings gradually developed over the last few episodes and my time reflecting on them. Instead of taking my mind off 1, I'd switch between 1 and 2 every couple of days. I'd have these big spikes going from feeling extremely bad to extreme relief the next day. I thought the shift from horrible to happy was a coincidence but now that I think about it, I was actually just trying to recover from that feeling by telling myself I was over it because of one little good detail. Whenever I felt so bad about this character, I'd keep watching the show, watch videos, read character wikis, find interviews from the creator to find something redeemable and sometimes it worked which gave me massive relief for a bit. All it took was a different perspective which shifted the trope into something I can understand and tolerate, and again I was over it. I pretended that I was misinterpreting the character this whole time which was partly true. This already made me happy but it was still on the back of my mind until there was one moment in the show that made me the happiest I've felt watching anything. I already convinced myself I was over it, the sequel books coincidentally acknowledged my feelings, the creator said in an interview that the exact thing I wanted could happen, and then the show went the extra mile with this beautiful scene. This shot of 1 blew me away and abolished what was left of the horrible feelings entirely. I was so happy that I didn't care if the creator followed through. That got my 1 feelings out of the woods and about 3 months later I kept reading the books and a similar moment happened with 2. For some reason after that, they both started creeping back in gradually over the next week and I stopped my addiction with this show and planned to return to it in exactly I year when I should be over it. I had two chapters left but I thought I'd leave the show entirely, not look at anything related to this show for now until something good happened. Over 2020, 1 and 2 would creep up in my head now and again and remind me of their existence but around 11 months, I was convinced I was over 1 but looking back on it, I was making room for 4 new characters to uncontrollably think about with this thing or trope. I theorized that if I had a strong feeling of nostalgia from my time away from this show, that would do it for me. The soundtrack was very good and manipulative and probably the only reason I watched past episode 1. The idea of being a fan again wasn't looking good but I decided in exactly a year after I'll binge the soundtrack. It was overwhelming and I was unsure listening to it, it was still a great soundtrack but I wasn't getting the expected closure. I got a bad feeling and thought I hope I didn't restart 1 again and as usual, that started it again and I was disappointed in myself. Around October 2020 I just lay there and suddenly decided to evaluate this character as a whole and it hit harder then than it ever had, how completely unfair it is and stupid this character is. It was a while since I thought about this character and since I'd gotten worse, it really hurt now that I had all the information. It was like I was back at square 1 but as a different worse person who spent too long worrying about this fake person. I finally figured out exactly what it was that bothered me so much, and the realisation didn't help the way I thought an explanation would, it just made me stuck with no excuses. No shifting of perspectives, optimistic ending or 1 second good moment would ever get me out of this and I realized I'll never get closure. Since then, this character keeps showing up in my recommended in different instances. I think my situation is comparable to breakups. People stalk their ex's Instagram for the same reason I was watching the whole show, reading whole character wikis, character analysis videos, buying stuff from the show, finding every bit of content about this person. I've recently figured out what it was about this character that bothered me so much. A fundamental part of the ""thing"" I'm afraid of is that I could not empathize with this character in the present, but I could in flashbacks and the alternate timeline. What breaks me so hard is how 1 just accepts it which is so unrealistic with the only explanation being ""fictional fantasy bullshit"". Quoting this character's dumb catchphrase would give it away but it's essentially just ""shit happens"", referring to some horrific traumatising shit, which is such a shitty moral and the braindead edgelord fanbase eat it up. I saw a thumbnail that was the same shot that I said ""made me the happiest I've felt watching anything"", but now it makes me feel horrible. I instinctively thought I fking hate you, and the person who made this video. I think it was one of that garbage cringe character compilations with music and I'm imagining what that would look like and that video probably picked the scenes I'm worst affected by because they're the most ""epic"". There's a specific screenshot in the show that keeps getting in my recommended and it makes me so sad. I know how extremely selfish that is and I'm so ashamed of it, this is the saddest I've ever felt over anything in my life. I know I'm a fucking moron how I can mistake something this small as something that should be on my mind than a pandemic. I'm extremely helplessly fucking stupid and disappointed in myself. I'm not autistic and I don't have a mental illness or anything. As far as I know, I have nothing mentally wrong with me which I'd rather than be this stupid and difficult to figure out. But if there is and this can go away with medication or something, what might that be? I'm not asking for a Reddit diagnosis, I just want to know what is likely so I can research, just something I can google. I was pretty much done with this talking about this character then as we speak I've become aware of 1's official ending and I don't know how I feel. It made the most sense that if everything in this fictional show went back to normal, I would as well since that's how it started. Something distressing happening in the show and I reacted with distress. But It was a very predictable and open-ended closure that didn't mean a lot to me. Every single optimistic moment I found from this show had been abandoned. Critically I guess it was a masterpiece of an ending but I can't think rationally. As I expected, nothing would have officially ended my feelings of this type of character or person but the ending wasn't as satisfying as I've been building it up the past 2 years in my head. The fact that one of my revenge fantasies I used to cope with came true in the show, spoken by one of the other characters which made me feel so validated, just for it to be forgotten immediately. I've never been this disappointed. Now that I know the ending, I don't know what to think or feel about it yet it still feels like a huge deal. before last year I probably would have loved this ending but I've got so much worse and would satisfy me now is so exaggerated and unpractical. I at least thought that since I've been feeling so much strong emotion there'd be at least some payoff. I'm shaking and sweating and crying right now. What a waste of emotions. And seeing all the fans celebrate this just continues to make me feel so alone. I don't understand how people watch movies. I can't watch fking entertainment.

What's currently motivating me is a character we'll call 3 who I've decided feels worse than 1. While I was watching 1 and 2's show in May 2019, I was watching another show which I found amazing. There was a significant detail that I completely missed in the show that made 3 similar to 1. I really genuinely loved this show and I was looking at character wikis out of interest and accidentally found this detail. It was just a few words that change a lot, except I didn't care at all and still loved this show, it was a great distraction from my current bad feelings about 1. This confirmed to me that I must just have a problem with that show and the two characters exclusive to it, the use of this character trope in anything else won't take away something that I really love. Then it had been exactly a year since I finished watching the show with 3 who at this point wasn't officially on the list. I decided to not watch that show again just to be safe even though I loved it. About 6 months after, I was happy that I got to enjoy it before I got any worse, now, but it had got to the point where my vague memories were enough to get hung up about. I was so desperate for closure and a bit in denial that I made the same mistake with 1 and researched to remind myself what happened and prove my memories wrong. I hoped that I read the wiki wrong or there was a moment of closure that I missed. I got sucked in as usual and read paragraphs that describe every detail, confirming what happened and more. 3 came up relentlessly for the next 5 days which by the end drove me to tears. This show didn't care to portray the type of feelings I was having but rather just show the trope happen as the events play out as it wasn't a focus of the show and not even a main character. It was inevitable and undoable unlike 1. Its been so long since I watched the show that I attempted to fill the gaps between scenes I can remember. One of these scenes I knew had to have happened that I'll call a ""transition"" and I had a disturbing dream about it. In the dream, I was rewatching it on Netflix and my sub-conscience almost tried to create some closure, and I woke up disappointed that it wasn't canon. Since August, 3 has come up occasionally in my mind but only every few months.

Today on a walk for no reason that I could remember, I started thinking about 3. It was worse than usual so I decided to risk looking for opinions on the internet to justify these feelings and found that even though this show gets constant 10/10s, a lot of people don't like it. I clicked on an article listing scenes that were ""too disturbing"", I turned the brightness down so I couldn't see the images or text, I just wanted a glance to see my feelings validated and I don't know why I do this when every time it backfires. Even with the brightness fully down, the third scene listed as the ""transition"" that I had nightmares about, although I had no memory of how the scene went, but this screenshot was definitely the canon event that my brain tried to interpret in that dream. It shows that I've changed two years ago that this scene had such little effect on me to be completely absent from my memory. All I could see was a dark silhouette of a character, and glimpses of a couple of words confirming it was 3. Unfortunately, this little information bridged the gab between the scenes I could remember and how it happened. I was holding my phone as far from my face as possible to attempt to mental gymnastic my way out of it and pretend it's a silhouette of something else but as hard as I tried to deny it, the information was already there. I already saw a glimpse of 3's name which couldn't be the name of another character in the show, I couldn't unread a significant word or unsee the silhouette, what it was implying and on top of that being reminded of the existence of this character next to what I could remember. I tried looking closely at a fraction of the image to see if the hair was a different color to prove it wasn't the same character but the more I looked I could tell it was 3. There was a word that triggers me in any context but this is probably the absolute worst time I've seen this word used. This was on an article calling this event disturbing, even if that justified me feeling this horrible about it, it didn't help and just acknowledged that this really did happen. I know it's not real but an entire team came up with this and were comfortable enough to develop this character through concept art, different design iterations and painstaking animation and not a single one couldn't have been as disturbed as I am and that makes me feel so alone. I can't comprehend how they could all create this story.

I found some scissors and cut as deep in my thigh a few times as hard as I could handle. I've never self-harmed before or felt motivated to but this felt necessary, I wanted to hurt myself as much as I could in the least visible or damaging way. I'm tempted to cut some more right now but I don't want to get carried away. Being an absolute moron, I didn't think about how stupid it was to leave these scares so I cleaned them a bit. This is the first time I've externally done anything significant about my feelings. I couldn't not help cutting myself like most self-harmers say but I wanted to do it and made a decision and I want to do it again.

I have questions. Please tell me what I need, obviously besides therapy. When the circumstances are right, I'll try therapy but that isn't possible for me at the moment. Down to the very basics, what should I do? Should I stop using the internet altogether and continue to never leave the house? Are there healthy ways of coping? Is it better to face my fears or completely isolate myself because neither has worked? This show could easily get a Hollywood remake and become the next Star Wars, what do I do then? What's wrong with me, and what words am I that I can google? I pretty much have no friends or social life, is that the issue? Reddit says it's disenfranchised grief, or I've had a spiritual awakening. I know I'm not insecure, if I was the best at everything ever, I'd still feel the same because these feelings aren't about me, they're mostly about strangers on the internet or made-up people who fit this type of person. Also, it would make me feel a lot better if people understood how stupid this is rather than how valid my feelings are. I need confirmation that I'm not crazy for thinking my feelings are wrong.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure if this sub is the right place or if deppressed is the right word but I thought I&amp;#39;d give it a shot. Apologies if this is unstructured and confusing. I&amp;#39;ve been writing this post for 4 months but I got so triggered last night and cut myself, I&amp;#39;m desperate for advice, so I thought I&amp;#39;d just merge all of the information together. I&amp;#39;ve tried to be vague and leave out details about the source because I&amp;#39;m so ashamed of it. As well as a direction and advice, I&amp;#39;m interested to know what people can make of this and if I deserve to complain about my feelings. I feel lonely and I&amp;#39;ll never get to talk about the source of these feelings in any more detail than this post on an anonymous account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not the type of fear anyone can empathize with or understand. If I had a fear this bad but of someone being killed, taken advantage of, those are understandably disturbing thoughts, even the idea of not happening to me but someone else, you would be able to sympathise with me. But comparing my fears to something reasonable like fear of someone dying is giving me too much credit. If I was to speak about the specifics, you&amp;#39;ll unconsciously think &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m glad I&amp;#39;m not like that&amp;quot; which is why I have to keep this so vague. I can&amp;#39;t take these feelings seriously so imagine how impossible it is for someone without all this context. These feelings of grief or heartbreak (if they&amp;#39;re the right words) started with a fictional character I didn&amp;#39;t like who I would uncontrollably think about, and that isn&amp;#39;t even the unusual part. At first glance, my feelings are stupid and unreasonable which is true, but it&amp;#39;s a lot more complicated than that, with layers and some contradictions. I was perfectly fine, then gradually over two and a half years, my negative feelings have gone from a fictional character, to a type of fictional character, to a few real people, to pretty much anyone and now I fking hate the world I&amp;#39;m in and the people I&amp;#39;m stuck with. I hate the way people are the way they talk. I can&amp;#39;t respect what people do to satisfy themselves and each other. My stomach and heart aches, It&amp;#39;s difficult to think about anything else, my mind is on a group of random people. Trying not to distract myself from anything because it takes a lot of concentration to do this much mental gymnastics and denying. My only temporary escape is to write in this post, and even now I find myself stopping just to rethink over and over and reanalyse everything they said, what was hopefully exaggerated, what was figurative, what was literal, just from a YouTube comment of someone giving their life story, that I found 3 months ago for example. When I&amp;#39;ve posted before, I get asked if had a concussion, spiritual awakening, repressed memories, but I honestly have no explanation. I used to be terrified of a very different trope when I was very young up to my teenage years. I guess that&amp;#39;s similar but it only scared me, it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt me like this. Other than that, I&amp;#39;ve had a healthy childhood, not lost anyone close to me, never been abused, maybe a little emotional abuse, my parents are very sensitive too. I currently have no friends, crippling social anxiety, and I&amp;#39;m lonely but that seems like another less important issue that won&amp;#39;t solve anything&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s call this fictional character &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;. I may have gone into unnecessary detail explaining this fake person so here&amp;#39;s a TL;DR: A character in a show made me slightly uncomfortable, it gradually built up and I was thinking about 1 all the time, I became a fan of the show as a defence mechanism that keeps backfiring. The same thing happened to another character in the same show and they both equally discomforted me so I never looked at the show again. The next year, the fear became less bearable and I developed negative feelings for 8 other fictional and not fictional people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If person reading this can figure out the show I&amp;#39;m describing, I&amp;#39;d prefer you to tell me without naming any names. In November 2018 I watched a TV show because I was bored. There was a scene focused on a character and the dialogue didn&amp;#39;t sit right with me and I felt a very brief feeling of discomfort before I immediately forgot about it. This was the type of forgettable character that I found too bland to even form an opinion of at the time. I knew that I&amp;#39;d forget about this character&amp;#39;s existence as soon as I stopped watching the show which was true for about 4 months, then I got very subconscious flashbacks, that were too subtle to acknowledge, I just felt a few little discomforting vague memories randomly. Around March, I decided to watch the rest of the first season, pretending no weird feelings were happening. As 1 showed up, I was trying to remove these feelings. It was a sympathetic situation so I told myself to feel sympathy which made me do fine for the rest of the season. Up to this point, everything I was thinking was pretty much subconscious. Now that I finished I went back and watched the scene with the dialogue I didn&amp;#39;t like, now that I thought I was over it and nothing changed, I just felt bad again. Although I knew I was having weird feelings, I hadn&amp;#39;t acknowledged yet that this was actually a thing. This entirely new emotion made no sense to me. I felt overwhelmed and sad but not at all like crying. Just to add to the confusion of that feeling, it was about a made up person who I didn&amp;#39;t even know the name of. Further adding to the confusion I never heard of anyone being this sad over such a specific thing in fiction or real life. Most people get upset about death or breakups. I can&amp;#39;t say when this exactly began within November to March but this was the moment I consider the start. I started to think about these feelings with words and I told myself something along the lines of &amp;quot;this needs to go away, I&amp;#39;m feeling bad because of a fictional character&amp;quot;. I know now that I shouldn&amp;#39;t patiently waited for time to pass and none of this would have happened but I didn&amp;#39;t know that and my only solution was to find whatever I needed in the rest of the show which mostly backfired but occasionally helped. These bad feelings drew me into the show and into becoming a fan for a number of reasons. I was a fan because it was proof that I wasn&amp;#39;t feeling bad, so in denial in a way.

I believe the opposite happened where instead of taking it less seriously because of the goofiness, it proved to me that I&amp;#39;ll take anything seriously no matter how goofy something is. I even considered getting one of those funko figures even though I don&amp;#39;t collect those and I&amp;#39;m not really a fan of collecting overpriced merch.

Now that I know the ending, I don&amp;#39;t know what to think or feel about it yet it still feels like a huge deal. before last year I probably would have loved this ending but I&amp;#39;ve got so much worse and would satisfy me now is so exaggerated and unpractical. I at least thought that since I&amp;#39;ve been feeling so much strong emotion there&amp;#39;d be at least some payoff. I&amp;#39;m shaking and sweating and crying right now. What a waste of emotions. And seeing all the fans celebrate this just continues to make me feel so alone. I don&amp;#39;t understand how people watch movies. I can&amp;#39;t watch fking entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s currently motivating me is a character we&amp;#39;ll call 3 who I&amp;#39;ve decided feels worse than 1. While I was watching 1 and 2&amp;#39;s show in May 2019, I was watching another show which I found amazing. There was a significant detail that I completely missed in the show that made 3 similar to 1. I really genuinely loved this show and I was looking at character wikis out of interest and accidentally found this detail. It was just a few words that change a lot, except I didn&amp;#39;t care at all and still loved this show, it was a great distraction from my current bad feelings about 1. This confirmed to me that I must just have a problem with that show and the two characters exclusive to it, the use of this character trope in anything else won&amp;#39;t take away something that I really love. Then it had been exactly a year since I finished watching the show with 3 who at this point wasn&amp;#39;t officially on the list. I decided to not watch that show again just to be safe even though I loved it. About 6 months after, I was happy that I got to enjoy it before I got any worse, now, but it had got to the point where my vague memories were enough to get hung up about. I was so desperate for closure and a bit in denial that I made the same mistake with 1 and researched to remind myself what happened and prove my memories wrong. I hoped that I read the wiki wrong or there was a moment of closure that I missed. I got sucked in as usual and read paragraphs that describe every detail, confirming what happened and more. 3 came up relentlessly for the next 5 days which by the end drove me to tears. This show didn&amp;#39;t care to portray the type of feelings I was having but rather just show the trope happen as the events play out as it wasn&amp;#39;t a focus of the show and not even a main character. It was inevitable and undoable unlike 1. Its been so long since I watched the show that I attempted to fill the gaps between scenes I can remember. One of these scenes I knew had to have happened that I&amp;#39;ll call a &amp;quot;transition&amp;quot; and I had a disturbing dream about it. In the dream, I was rewatching it on Netflix and my sub-conscience almost tried to create some closure, and I woke up disappointed that it wasn&amp;#39;t canon. Since August, 3 has come up occasionally in my mind but only every few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today on a walk for no reason that I could remember, I started thinking about 3. It was worse than usual so I decided to risk looking for opinions on the internet to justify these feelings and found that even though this show gets constant 10/10s, a lot of people don&amp;#39;t like it. I clicked on an article listing scenes that were &amp;quot;too disturbing&amp;quot;, I turned the brightness down so I couldn&amp;#39;t see the images or text, I just wanted a glance to see my feelings validated and I don&amp;#39;t know why I do this when every time it backfires. Even with the brightness fully down, the third scene listed as the &amp;quot;transition&amp;quot; that I had nightmares about, although I had no memory of how the scene went, but this screenshot was definitely the canon event that my brain tried to interpret in that dream. It shows that I&amp;#39;ve changed two years ago that this scene had such little effect on me to be completely absent from my memory. All I could see was a dark silhouette of a character, and glimpses of a couple of words confirming it was 3. Unfortunately, this little information bridged the gab between the scenes I could remember and how it happened. I was holding my phone as far from my face as possible to attempt to mental gymnastic my way out of it and pretend it&amp;#39;s a silhouette of something else but as hard as I tried to deny it, the information was already there. I already saw a glimpse of 3&amp;#39;s name which couldn&amp;#39;t be the name of another character in the show, I couldn&amp;#39;t unread a significant word or unsee the silhouette, what it was implying and on top of that being reminded of the existence of this character next to what I could remember. I tried looking closely at a fraction of the image to see if the hair was a different color to prove it wasn&amp;#39;t the same character but the more I looked I could tell it was 3. There was a word that triggers me in any context but this is probably the absolute worst time I&amp;#39;ve seen this word used. This was on an article calling this event disturbing, even if that justified me feeling this horrible about it, it didn&amp;#39;t help and just acknowledged that this really did happen. I know it&amp;#39;s not real but an entire team came up with this and were comfortable enough to develop this character through concept art, different design iterations and painstaking animation and not a single one couldn&amp;#39;t have been as disturbed as I am and that makes me feel so alone. I can&amp;#39;t comprehend how they could all create this story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found some scissors and cut as deep in my thigh a few times as hard as I could handle. I&amp;#39;ve never self-harmed before or felt motivated to but this felt necessary, I wanted to hurt myself as much as I could in the least visible or damaging way. I&amp;#39;m tempted to cut some more right now but I don&amp;#39;t want to get carried away. Being an absolute moron, I didn&amp;#39;t think about how stupid it was to leave these scares so I cleaned them a bit. This is the first time I&amp;#39;ve externally done anything significant about my feelings. I couldn&amp;#39;t not help cutting myself like most self-harmers say but I wanted to do it and made a decision and I want to do it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have questions. Please tell me what I need, obviously besides therapy. When the circumstances are right, I&amp;#39;ll try therapy but that isn&amp;#39;t possible for me at the moment. Down to the very basics, what should I do? Should I stop using the internet altogether and continue to never leave the house? Are there healthy ways of coping? Is it better to face my fears or completely isolate myself because neither has worked? This show could easily get a Hollywood remake and become the next Star Wars, what do I do then? What&amp;#39;s wrong with me, and what words am I that I can google? I pretty much have no friends or social life, is that the issue? Reddit says it&amp;#39;s disenfranchised grief, or I&amp;#39;ve had a spiritual awakening. I know I&amp;#39;m not insecure, if I was the best at everything ever, I&amp;#39;d still feel the same because these feelings aren&amp;#39;t about me, they&amp;#39;re mostly about strangers on the internet or made-up people who fit this type of person. Also, it would make me feel a lot better if people understood how stupid this is rather than how valid my feelings are. I need confirmation that I&amp;#39;m not crazy for thinking my feelings are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

I am trying my best. It's-of course, OF COURSE it's not good enough! I think I'll have a breakdown soon. I think I'll be on my way out soon. 

I feel like everything I do wrong is a gigantic reflection of the sort of person I am. It further justifies my own disbelief in myself. I can't forgive myself for even my smallest mistakes.

Nothing is changing. Nothing seems to matter. Nobody likes me. Nobody cares about me. I want to run into a freeway. I want to beat myself up until I can't breathe anymore. I hate myself. I HATE myself. And I don't blame anyone for feeling the same.

Raised in a family where  criticize and laugh at others  is ""funny"" and the normal, (in the respect i had a lot of luck with my mom, she is totally diferent and a person to be proud of), so i had always a low  self-esteem , and they didnt bother with the ""social part"" of education, basically i had no friends, even with the start of the school, i  I spent recesses alone just thinking in my mental world (to be honest i didint remember so much about the reasons of this one, but i think it was mostly because other kids where mean, basically i wore cheap  clothing , and until like the age of 9 or 10, i didint even care a bit about  comb my hair  and all of that things, i wasnt important for me even in others).

&amp;#x200B;

In secondary things changed a bit, i mean, i was still being bullied for others, they even get expulsed of the institute for that (one day the burned a bit of my hair with a  lighter ), but i did some friends, the problem?, not much later  I felt totally used because people is always there when you're generous but didint stay longer or care much, for example i didint know hoy to swim well (basically the only day i remember going young, my aunt put me in the water holding just my hand, meanwhile the others even my father was just laughing of me having terror and ""drowning "", lesson learned never go out without mom) , and i was always alone at the shore, with noone caring, they just getting in the deep.

&amp;#x200B;

To this point I couldn't say i was the happiest person, but idk, for luck i didint have to much trouble with most of the subjects , i had good grades in the most with just paying atention in class, but with the ""just study this and puke"", i was horrible, i coulndt put me on it, and always ended in tears in front of the books(same with the homework , but this one with more self-blame, and just letting the day without doing anything for the guilt and maybe doing it in the last time of nigth). 

(I had to point that to keep moral, i was mostly playing videogames and that things, was my way of keep mind decent)

&amp;#x200B;

When things started to go worse is that point when you need to know what do you want do with your life, i had zero passion for anything, and to be honest i even lack the desire that i see in others of have things, and make then ""work hard"" for it.

It went worse and worse until it just exploded in university, there i was good in practical subjects( maths and programing), but study that much for the study ones was just imposible, even with the easiest that where just to fill. 

For this point i was living alone in a study, and started to socialice a lot more, even a girl get interested in me, but second year once i started to realize there wasnt future for me in that way, it started nail for nail in my coffing, the girl who show interest in me just changed her mind (it seems she was just getting moral support of ""lot"" of guys, that way i learned if a person say they like you but dont want to   introduce you to other friends is a bad signal),  my stuy started to be full of garbage to the point in ended with flys (the biggest i had seen in my life, proud of them :P), and in the darkest days, just laying in the bed for 3 days barely even driking water of a bottle i have near, i ended getting up when tears where not enough to win, and needed to go for a piss, atleast i didint on the point of piss myself .

  
When i returned to my city, i just ended all the communication with all the people i meet, in part for shame, in part because in the end i didint thing of anyone as a close friend that can understand me, just people to spend my time on ( on the other part i had really good feelings helping others, and lisening them, but in the end i just do it for the self-esteem of being usefull i think).

&amp;#x200B;

Next its just a boring second grade study and work  here and there with my father, at his point anyone that could see me would say i had a perfect life, i mean for luck i didint need to work the  hardest  because  pasive income (all those years of cheap  clothing , no  travels , etc,  were amortized ),  i got a girlfriend, but after 5 years(like 2 of serious  relationship  ) when i wanted to get it real and start a family , she just said no, it apears that my lack of desire in life wasnt good for her, even i lived for her 24h, with a lof of nigths at the phone talking in the bad days, and event doing university works for her in the most stressful days, she said that she where thinking for about a year waiting for me to change of leave me, this hurted me even more, cause i just felt even more used.  

&amp;#x200B;

So here i'm, again rejecting other time every people you would call friends, and letting days just past, because i didint have the desire to do anything, (atleast look the good side, i didint have trouble following corona safety, its going to do like 2 years now of not going with anyone out, doing quarantine before even quarantine existed).

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest i dont know what to really expect from here, but idk, anything would be a help i supose, even knowing that people like me can be really loved, because i think is the only thing i want in life, a person that just stay with you, that return home with you and the end of the day and dont just forget you, a person that do plans with you, (i would just  adapt  at her tastes like i always do with others cause i didint have mines really).

&amp;#x200B;

To end, thanks for your time, and sorry for the bad grammar i'm not a native speaker,  it already feel a little better (yesterday i coulnt sleep a bit, because mental boom at a bit of  anxiety).

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory: I had a very abusive childhood, dad went to prison and mom was going guy to guy and I only remember one that was actually a good guy. I moved in with my grandma who was sick and was on oxygen. For over a year I took care of her before I went to school and after her hospice nurse left at night. I woke up one morning and found her, afterwards I had to move back in with my mom.
Her current boyfriend was on meth and extremely abusive to both of us. I had a fold out bed in the garage with a little desk and a computer that I would play games on to escape. I woke up countless nights to them fighting about sex and cheating and whatever else he could come up with. Me and my mom would pack up and leave and sleep in her car until she brought me to school the next day. We always ended up going back, he broke her arm and I got my ass kicked. She stayed with him.
One week I went camping with a friends family and when I came back they had both disappeared and nobody had seen either of them since I left.
I got put into foster care and eventually found out my mom moved 1500 miles away, I didn’t talk to her for 10 years.

So I have had issues with drugs and alcohol since I was like 13/14. Got expelled from multiple schools and ended up in a continuation school that probably saved my life at that point. That’s where I met my now wife. Once I graduated I started doing better with my depression, life was good, I was working a good job, driving a nice car, beautiful girlfriend… etc… the whole time I was kinda jealous that she had a family that loves her and I don’t, still feel that way.

Jump forward 8ish years. I’m clean except for a couple beers a week, We’re engaged, first baby on the way. I lose my job because the new owner wanted a whole new staff to pay them less. I find a new job that I hate but pays the bills and end up drinking more and more. Baby was born. Our home burned down and all we got out were us and the pets, also we just changed out insurance and it didn’t kick in for that yet so it was a total write off. Then my dog died. Then we moved out of the area and my wife could transfer but I couldn’t so I was out of a job and she was working full time while I watched the baby.

I’m at a point where I feel useless, I don’t feel fit to be a father. I’ve dealt with depression my whole life and this is getting worse than it’s ever been. If it weren’t for my little princess I probably wouldn’t be here at this point. I know I need to be here for her, so she doesn’t deal with what I had to.

I have no family other than hers and my baby that’s too young to understand that daddy’s hurting thankfully, I have no friends because of moving. So I can’t just open up and vent to anybody","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr traumatic childhood, shit luck in life&lt;/p&gt;

Do you have a binder for thought patterns or did you do daily self-check-ins? Do you regularly mood-log to identify cognitive distortions or do you do worksheets from a workbook? What has helped the most?

As a matter of fact, she had those before, those types of depressive episodes, where she will isolate herself from the whole world and then she will appear out of nowhere and will be completely fine. Those episodes last for about a week or two, max. three weeks.

It's never been a good one but figured I am much older, it's been almost 10 years and I can move past things. 

But nothing is different. It's a quiet house and we don't even talk to each other and walk around one another. I'm having thoughts about hurting myself again, something that I haven't thought about in 10 years. 

I would heat up a butter knife and burn my arms &amp; thighs. I am not in counseling and last night was the final push I needed to realize I'm not okay. I have not been happy or experienced anything other dread,sorrow and self pity for the past few years. 

I graduated college, got a well paying job, promotions and did not celebrate any of it.  My family is there for me but I don't trust them or many people in my life. It's becoming a much bigger issue as I get older. I can't keep this up and it's wearing me down. I don't open myself to relationships and stay guarded the entire time. I can't help but feel I make others uncomfortable and it doubles when I realize how uncomfortable I am around people or a new space. 

I have problems I need to work through and am reminding myself I am strong enough to do so. I can't talk about any of this with friends or family because I think im burdening them with issues only I can solve. 

I may sound like a text book case...and that's what makes me realize that these emotions are ""normal"" amongst a certain population of people. I'm working to address the emotion and work through it but it won't go away, it's been years and these feelings have always crept in. 

It's all in my head and I am stronger mentally and physically than before. It's been a weird couple days.


I just wanted to write this and get it out there. I'm about to spend the weekend with friends and did not want to bring these thoughts with me.

Happy 4th.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since covid, I have moved home with the goal of working on my relationship with my family. It&amp;#39;s never been a good one but figured I am much older, it&amp;#39;s been almost 10 years and I can move past things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But nothing is different. It&amp;#39;s a quiet house and we don&amp;#39;t even talk to each other and walk around one another. I&amp;#39;m having thoughts about hurting myself again, something that I haven&amp;#39;t thought about in 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would heat up a butter knife and burn my arms &amp;amp; thighs. I am not in counseling and last night was the final push I needed to realize I&amp;#39;m not okay. I have not been happy or experienced anything other dread,sorrow and self pity for the past few years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I graduated college, got a well paying job, promotions and did not celebrate any of it.  My family is there for me but I don&amp;#39;t trust them or many people in my life. It&amp;#39;s becoming a much bigger issue as I get older. I can&amp;#39;t keep this up and it&amp;#39;s wearing me down. I don&amp;#39;t open myself to relationships and stay guarded the entire time. I can&amp;#39;t help but feel I make others uncomfortable and it doubles when I realize how uncomfortable I am around people or a new space. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have problems I need to work through and am reminding myself I am strong enough to do so. I can&amp;#39;t talk about any of this with friends or family because I think im burdening them with issues only I can solve. &lt;/p&gt;

First things first, English is not my first language, so my post is probably full of mistakes or inaccuracies (btw feel free to point them out, it’s a good way for me to improve). 

I’ve been suffering from depression for 10 years now (save for high school). I’ve always had ups and downs, but a few weeks ago I was at one my lowest points so far and I decided to take a weight off. My first depression was triggered by some serious bullying in middle school. Since I didn’t tell anyone back then, the culprits weren’t punished, and it prevented me from moving on. 

I knew I couldn’t change the past, but I wanted to do something. Therefore, I created a fake Facebook account and sent a message to the bully who started it all and relentlessly bullied me for 3 years. The message itself wasn’t offensive at all (it was something like “I suffered because of you, I hope you’ve become more empathetic”), my goal was just to leave everything behind me by saying at least something.

However, it turns out I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He sent me like 40 messages, and it seems he mistook me for someone else. From what I’ve read, he’s got some serious issues with his ex (blackmail, death threats, harassment…) and thought that I was her. In his last message, he said that he was going to file a bullying complaint against “me”. I panicked and tried to explain to him that there was a huge misunderstanding about my identity, but he didn’t believe it and he was getting even more aggressive. I deleted my fake Facebook account before things got worse. 

And now I’m afraid of what might happen. I didn’t say anything offensive or illegal, but I don’t know. I’m imagining stuff like the police coming to my house thinking that it was me all along and not his ex and I had my first panic attack after visualizing the scene. More, if I understood correctly, he’s become depressed and suicidal because of what happened with his ex and in one of his messages he said that he would probably kill himself in a few weeks. I know I’m not the one responsible for his situation and although he was (and probably still is) a terrible person, maybe this message took a toll on his mental health, and I feel bad about this possibility. 

I’ve been overwhelmed by everything in the past few months, and I managed to make it worse with this stupid message I sent. Maybe I’m overthinking, but I’ve been panicking a lot since then.

Hi guys.  I'm new in reddit so I'm sorry  if I make some mistakes while posting this. I could really use your advice. Thank you in advance for reading this. 

I'm in last year of a very difficult engineering degree (at least for me) and I've hated every minute of it. I don't regret studying this at all, and the reason I did it is to have more possibilities of securing a better future abroad(according to me) . All I can think of is how to get out of this country (I'm obsessed, I recognize it)

I've done this last semester online ( like almost everyone in the world). The difference is that I live in a a very complicated country  with almost no internet availability ( No wifi and I can pay just 1GB of data a week, and I'm lucky ) and with that we pretty much just exchange pdf's with our teachers.No conferences, no videos and no zoom. They send us assignments and we answer it. It's been really demanding. 

So with this regime, I've just lied in my bed all day, and I just get up to do a minimum effort to do an assignment and go back to bed. It's really difficult for me to leave my bed even to clean my room or to eat I don't know how to explain it but sometimes I don't even know if it's day or night . I feel like I can't get things done. Doing anything even feels extremely hard. I really hope it's just lazyness but I haven't leave my house in almost a year and a half ( except for when I went to get a covid vaccine)  and I barely leave my room.

I was informed yesterday that I failed a subject (I had taken an exam) and I have to retake it in August. If I fail again I'm going to have to repeat the year. 😢. I feel like I can't take this anymore, I have like 3 subjects more I'm doing assignments of, and I am supposed to have some advancements in my thesis and I haven't written a word, I'm basically ghosting my tutor. And I don't have any friend I can rely on. 
I'm so obsessed with just graduating and getting the fuck out of here that I haven't realized that I might not even graduate. I need to know how to be focus in the present and in what I have to do and not in the uncertainty of the future, I get really ansious about this.
I don't know if I'm overreacting at the heat of the moment but I feel like I can't get things done. 
And I feel like wherever I look there are just bad news, empty store shelves empty, pharmacy shelves, covid cases going up, now besides all of our problems there's a fucking hurricane coming our way, like how tf people stay hopeful. I feel like I want to drop everything.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year Engineering student about to drop everything&lt;/p&gt;

Not that long I meet a guy, that I’ve already previously talked about before, who knew he would have such a significant impact on me when everything was short lived. 

Anyways I meet him in a rough time and I think I used him as a distraction to the chaos of emotions that I felt. Now this is already bad I know but to make it even worse he wasn’t the best. He would purposely try to make me feel/look stupid and at one point told me that I “lacked common sense” all to which I would brush off. And thats not the problem because these things that he would do towards me really wouldn’t affect me. I knew that his opinion of me was of little value. So why even go back? Well I think my problem is that I’ve never truly felt loved by someone and although he verbally sucked he offered comfort in the forms of physical touch. I’m not naive or stupid I knew that to him I was seen as someone dumb but usable. This was later proven true when he randomly stopped texting me which again didn’t hurt. 

What did hurt was the fact that in that short amount of time I became dependent on the physical touch that made me feel not so empty and sad. So when that stopped I truly felt devastated. Which is a weird thing might I add, crying not for a person but what that person could provide. 

But let me further explain, he didn’t know that I’m dealing with depression and that whenever it came to us cuddling and him kissing me it felt like I was whole. It made me forget everything because this was something that I never experienced and found out I loved. My mom /family was never the one to show affection especially if it was physical. I couldn’t tell you of a time that I hugged or that my mother hugged me, she also was never the one to verbally demonstrate affection. So when I started to feel affection it became really emotional for me. I never knew how much I needed that/ was deprived of. 

Funny because I’ve always dealt with my depression alone and although he never knew it those few days that we were together i didn’t feel so lonely. 

Anyways the aftermath of that was even worse than I had originally been in. I felt alone and empty and like the whole weight of my sadness was back on me. I spent it the first few days trying to convince myself that I was fine before I gave in and fully allowed myself to feel sad. The sadness lasted a while and for a minute I thought that was my breaking point. But one day I got up and told myself I no longer wanted to deal with my depression and for some reason I began to feel better, there was a couple of things that I knew would trigger me and I purposely avoided them.

It was a regular weekday and started with my normal routine. No breakfast, shower, watch a little YouTube and then I went to class. I always arrive to class early, and when I used to wait for the professor to arrive, I’d read some news on my phone. But while I’m reading, I notice everyone around me starts acting weird. It was only a couple of people in the class, but they were all acting the same. They were sniffing and rubbing their noses, making comments like “do you smell that” and “it smells like shit.” But when they sniffed and rubbed their noses, it was in my direction. So I try to smell it, but I don’t smell anything. Eventually I smell something a little bit, but I couldn’t smell anything that irritate me the way it irritated the other students. By this point, I knew it was me. You ever just get that feeling? But then something happened to prove my hypothesis. I look to my right, and this guy 2 seats over from me is giving me the nastiest look and sniffing. He face was of pure disgust. I had never seen anyone look like that, let alone at me. The image of his face is something I’ll never forget. I try to sit through class, but it gets harder and harder and my anxiety keeps skyrocketing. When the professor came to my side of the room, she jumped at the smell and tried to play it off. After this, a lizard was on the whiteboard for some reason, and you know how students are. I used that opportunity to run to my dorm. When I got to why dorm, I took three showers that. Nothing changed. 

2 days later, I ditch school and go home early one morning, and tell my dad everything that happened. He told me I could go to the doctor, so I went. They gave me no answers. I’ll sum this part up. This is basically when I learned that my parents weren’t invincible and all knowing. In essence, they just wanted me to suck it up, even though they didn’t say it that way. Its easy to say that when you don’t have to deal with on the daily basis. I stayed home for a week, asking my family did they smell anything but they said no, which was probably true at the start. But eventually I noticed them rubbing their noses and making remarks about the smell, even though they aren’t directed at me. At one point, I knew they were lying to me and I didn’t know how to feel. I understood why but I also felt betrayed. I was confused. At first I couldn’t smell the odor at will, but over time I could. I wont get too gross, although it may be a little too late for that. 

I tried to say strong, but I couldn’t. Each day and every-time I had to deal with people, a piece of me was destroyed. I stopped going to class and layed in my dorm room staring at the sealing for 5 months straight. The neighbors on my hall would beat on walls, yell , and call be names through the window. I ate apples, ramen noodles, and only drunk water because I was too scared to go to the cafeteria. Eventually, I started living in my car in parking lots. Sleeping in it as well. I couldn’t escape no matter where I went. 

Over this time span, I visited about 7 or 8 clinics. I told one doctor my symptoms, and he literally asked me “what do you want me to do??” He gave me some anxiety meds and basically told me f off. Around December, a doctor diagnosed me with hemorrhoids. I finally learned what was causing this. At least I thought I did. 

I continued experiencing the same situation in the Spring of 2021, and then covid happened. During this time, I literally just hid in room depressed. Although this depression was not nearly as bad as it was when I was alone in my dorm room. It was so hard to live with myself. I didn’t want to be in the same room as myself, and I still don’t. I didn’t spend time with my family because I don’t want to see them rub their noses. I felt guilty for not spending time with them and I still am. I don’t know, I think I’m just weak or something. 

Eventually, in July of 2020, I ended up going to a gastroenterologist. (I should have went here first, but didn’t know how doctors worked, in terms of specialist and stuff). This guy tells me they were bad and I need surgery. Fast forward to December 2020, I get a Hemorrhoidectomy in hopes of solving the problem. And I had another in May of 2021. I still have the smell problem, which doesn’t make sense. 

And now we are in the present day. Throughout this all, I have become a social recluse. I stopped talking to my friends because I knew that they wouldn’t accept me like this. I couldn’t confront them like this. In this pathetic state. The pandemic was helpful in the sense that I could take courses online, now I don’t how to proceed. I can’t sit in class smelling like this. I don’t know what to do. I was thinking about just dropping out and leaving, or trying to get an internship and move out or something.  

I feel like I am a shell of my old self, and I don’t think I can get back there. Looking back, I don’t know how I haven’t offed myself yet. I think I’m too stubborn. But I also don’t want my family to mourn and experience something like that. I want to see my friends again and spend time with my family. I haven’t even had a gf yet. One thing this whole experience has taught me is that I wasn’t truly living before. All I did was play video games and jack off. I want to live, not whatever this is.

This all started about 2 weeks after I turned 20 in September 2019. I came down with catastrophic health problems. This wasn’t anything common, but it wasn’t life threatening…to other people that is. One day I woke up, and everything was just different. I’ll start with the day that everything changed; or when I noticed it changed. (Even though this was almost 2 years ago, I remember it like it was an hour ago)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Day Everything Changed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a regular weekday and started with my normal routine. No breakfast, shower, watch a little YouTube and then I went to class.

Admitted to multiple mental hospitals, several therapists, 2 wilderness therapy trips, and almost a decade wasted on RuneScape. Around 6 months ago I decided I wanted to stop spending all my time on a game and actually live my life. 

Quitting video games was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I lost my community, my purpose in life, my self worth, and a huge part of my identity. Over the following weeks I’d develop severe anxiety, body dysmorphia, and a dangerously high blood pressure. I’d spend days without moving at all, with my brain on a constant loop thinking about what a piece of shit human being I was. 

Despite how much easier my life was while playing video games, I didn’t want to give up and return to where I was, so I kept pushing myself. My biggest hurdle was having absolutely no confidence in myself or my social ability. People would try to start conversations with me, and I lived in constant fear of disappointing them or wasting their time. This led to some really painful social interactions that would make me want to give up and hide, like I should accept that I’ll just be alone forever. 

Eventually I realized that it doesn’t make sense to give other people that much control over my happiness. I set a goal for my life that I’m confident I can achieve, to give me something to think about other than my loneliness. I got a job, started going to the gym regularly, and I’ve used my free time to develop my programming skills. Knowing that I’m working towards a goal does 2 things: it helps you feel good about the work you put in each day, and it allows you to care less about other people’s opinions. Since developing this mindset I’ve had so much more fun talking to people! Sure, I say awkward shit almost constantly because I have aspergers and my processing speed isn’t the fastest, but I don’t let it get me down. When people can tell you’re enjoying a conversation, they’ll try to talk to you more regardless of whatever awkward shit you say. 

It’s been a horrible, horrible journey but I genuinely like the person I am now. I see my good qualities more clearly than my negative ones. I wake up most mornings excited for what I get to do that day. 

Good luck for everyone battling with depression, unless you’ve been through it it’s really hard to understand just how terrible depression is. The most important thing I’ve learned is you can never give up. You’ll have days that go so poorly you just want to put a bullet in your head and end all this bullshit. The hardest thing to do is to push past those feelings, understand tomorrow is a new day with new possibilities. And usually, the next day won’t be as bad (it might even be a good day!) individual days won’t be as bad if you can just focus on the progress you’ve made.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been depressed since the age of 11.

I kind of dont fit in, my few friends are the same way but still in a way better place. I think they just meet me on a regular basis to keep my sanity. Therapy is no option, to this point it only made everthing worse.

* loneliness is not the biggest problem, more like not beeing understood and beeing marked as the guy how loves his computers more than going out. Girls kind of beeing jerks, i dont say its probably not my issue, but no one wants to take time to talk to me. I think they mostly dont like introverts in my Area.

* My sister wants to kill herself, eventhough she said to her therapist its not my fault, it kind of feels like its mine, Im the bigger brother.

* I get real Anxious when im at bigger parties, its a feeling like dying, like my life is fading, nicotine seems to help in about 90% of the time, but I dont have the money to buy hundrets of cigarets.

I come from a household where there is a lot of stigma and lots of shaming for anything relating to mental illness where there's a lot of the ""why can you just do it"" and the ""thanks I'm cured"" kind of attitude, so I haven't been medically diagnosed yet (I'm a teen (M) ), but I believe I might have some symptoms of depression. I've always thought I'd had it, so I thought it would be good to talk about coping advice with other people and recieve some validation rather than live in a kind-of limbo where I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really ""close"" to any members of my family because honestly, they haven't always been the greatest to me. For example when I was kid I quickly learned not to trust my parents because they would use things I said against me or punish me not so great ways, and this fallout would last in a week of screaming, crying, hiding etc. They don't even know what I like to do, my hobbies, and my skills etc. It's been better as a teen, but still I can't work off the past, so I often feel ""trapped"" or ""alone"". Their actions and behaviors definately manifested a lot of anxiety in me, and it took years before I could actually look people in the face (I still struggle to do that). Anyways, I think this might have been a large part in creating my supposed depression, but honestly I have no clue.

&amp;#x200B;

Nowadays I have like waves of ""trances"" (if that's what I could call them?) where for days at a time I can't make myself do anything and I lose motivation (even taking a shower is hard) and I often can't make myself make food even if I'm hungry. In these periods I sleep like 18+ hours everyday until I have coldsweats and my parents always belittle me for being lazy, even though I feel horrible. The worse thing is that I'm losing motivation for things I like to do, and I just stare at the ceiling and feel bad about not doing anything. I just feel ""stuck/traped"" or ""in a dream"", if that makes sense? Like I wanna runaway/just not exist anymore. I also don't really ""feel"" anything? Like everything's just gray and uninteresting and I am not, per se, ""sad"", but I'm not like happy either.  I also recently heard about high-functioning depression and that really struck a chord with me. I appear pretty normal to my friends and ussually I can get things done, but right now it's gotten harder.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, because it's not diagnosed I can't get any kind of treatment, so I would love to have tips on how to just try to make it through? Personally I found daydreaming and just staring at the sky to be a bit effective, but I don't think that's a healthy coping mechanism...

I was brought up in a pretty abusive household. My childhood memories are filled with memories of domestic violence, abuse, and manipulation. For around the first 15 years of my life, I saw gore and blood on an almost daily basis. I often remember seeing my mom bleeding from her head after being hit with a pan, I've seen an almost severed and dangling finger, seen a person temporarily blinded by trauma to the eye, seen someone have a cardiac arrest and all of this has sort of brutalized me. Add to this manipulative abuse by a person that forbade me to leave home or have friends or talk back or dissent. 

I grew up isolated from people, connecting to the world via the internet, and became introverted over time. I hate being controlled and abused, but my feelings have become so numbed I am not really sure I can say I care for others. I just want to get away, beyond the reach of the person that has abused and controlled me so far. I have grappled with depression on and off for a couple of years, starting from the time I was 17.

The only thing going for me is an education that helps me fend for myself since I had to perform really well to be not abused for being a loser. I had to choose to study something I had no interest in and then again was coerced to pursue an MBA from a premier B school. My dad, the person that's been controlling me up until now, is pretty upbeat that I'm doing really well and wants me to pursue a rewarding career and marry a woman pretty soon. While I do believe he thinks he's doing what's best for me, I am just done.

I'm too brutalized to want to love a woman. In fact, I feel nothing but contempt for women. I dunno why. There's just too much repressed anger within that I can't ever allow to be seen. Whenever other folks at home talked back to my dad, it would invariably end in hours of violence unleashed on my mom followed by unceasing verbal abuse. This ensured I never dared to talk back. I've now internalized this habit and there's just no way I can express anger towards the person that abused me.

Do I hate my dad? I do. Do I want to take it out on him? I couldn't care less. I do not care for people anymore. I do not want to be reconciled. I do not want to be a family. I want to be left alone. I want distance and peace. I'm just so traumatized that I don't think I can stand the depressing rigor of a management career. I can't work long hours without wanting to kill myself. I'm already too broken to endure.

I don't make friends that easily. My social skills suck. It's not even that I like most people I see. I'm just too different from them. I'm filled with anger and hate. 

I am now saddled with a loan thanks to the MBA. I plan to pay off the loan and just drop off the map. I can always make enough to sustain myself. I'm not gonna marry, not going to rise up the career ladder. I'm going to try to find the will to live.

Is this the fault of God? God doesn't intervene that much in real life, does he? People do get murdered in the most gruesome ways one can imagine. It's up to me to avoid pain. Surely, a good God won't hate a guy for trying to avoid pain, would he? He might even help if I am earnest. My mom prayed God for 30 years but the abuse never stopped. Maybe God doesn't interfere. It's up to me to feel alive. What's the worst that can happen? Death? Life as it is right now is not any better. Hell? I sure hope I don't go to hell. 

I want nothing more right now than to have enough money in the bank, travel aimlessly, regain the will to live on the way and perhaps, do something that makes me feel happy.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TW - Graphic description of abuse&lt;/p&gt;

My dad calls me a &amp;quot;wounded bird&amp;quot; behind my back so there&amp;#39;s that... It&amp;#39;s so hard to feel so tied to an environment that&amp;#39;s not good for me. The simple answer would be be off on my own but I don&amp;#39;t know how I could be with all the mental and emotional problems I have. I get panic attacks just being too far away from my house... It&amp;#39;s all so frustrating it makes me not to want to be here anymore. I wish so badly I could live like a &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; woman in her 20s... I feel like such a failure and I honestly have no hope for the future as of now. Thank you for reading if you did. This was just a vent, honestly.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m witnessing a young relative of my father’s girlfriend, being told by her mother to visit all sorts of college campuses despite the family offering no financial support to her. Her household is abusive and she’s being strung along by her parents without a clue. It enrages me knowing how they’d treat her in such a way. It breaks my heart knowing that, in time, she’s going to be thrust into a very harsh reality. I recognize this train wreck waiting to happen and it reminds me of just how many more cases exactly like this one or worse are out there. Kids are born into households without a chance. Life is a roulette wheel of unfortunate circumstances and the lack of meaning just tops it all off. Putting this back into perspective terrifies me. I’m growing steadily more nihilistic as time passes and I don’t want that for myself, but it’s what I’m growing to fall in to.&lt;/p&gt;

Anyway, my stomach feels kind of weird, and I'm tired and want to sleep so I should try to relax. But it's so bothersome. It's tough to get my heartrate down and the feeling to pass. 

Does crying help? Or make it worse? Maybe I should listen to music...

And it happens for no damn good reason!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t need this keeping me up tonight. I just need to feel relaxed and comfortable. It&amp;#39;s so weird that nothing seems to trigger it either. It just...hits. Suddenly.

Breathe down, expanding your lower abdomen as you inhale

Feel each one, in... and out...

Hear each one

Know that in this very moment, you are here. 

With me

Breathing

Tense all the muscles in your arms, and bring your palms together without pressing

Move them against each other, feeling the gentle friction

Close your eyes

Take five more slow, deep breaths

Stay as long as you'd like, tensing your legs, wiggle your toes.

Take a break from your thoughts

Spend a few moments with your body.

&lt;p&gt;Breathe down, expanding your lower abdomen as you inhale&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel each one, in... and out...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hear each one&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Know that in this very moment, you are here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breathing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tense all the muscles in your arms, and bring your palms together without pressing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Move them against each other, feeling the gentle friction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close your eyes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take five more slow, deep breaths&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay as long as you&amp;#39;d like, tensing your legs, wiggle your toes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spend a few moments with your body.&lt;/p&gt;

The extent to which it might be debilitating differs from person to person. The cause of it might differ as well. 

Here's my version of it. I've been experiencing depression since I was 8. Looking back at what I had gone through as a child, my experiences shaped my mindset. Unfortunately, the experiences I had as a child were filled with abandonment, rejection, disappointment and breach of trust. There were also moments of realisation that acceptance could be achieved if I tried to be someone else. The playful and mischievous kid turned into a quiet, well-behaved, socially distant and awkward teenager in the hopes that his teachers would accept him. No friend gained though. Even my major was selected on the basis of ""what major would make my parents accept me?""

Isn't it weird that the very thing that you consciously try to avoid turns you into that very same monster? I made every attempt to not be like my Dad. Guess what? I'm so much like him. I tried so hard to be someone whom others would accept only to be rejected over and over. 

It got to a stage where I just gave up. ""Why bother?"" In my opinion, those are the two most dangerous words in the world. Thus began the downward spiral into the vortex of depression. A stage of depression where you become nonchalant about anyone and everything. You gradually lose the capacity to care. That's where I am right now as a 38 year old. Of course, with this conscious conditioning, it has a biochemical effect on your body to adapt to your new way of 'being'. This was when I met 'Anhedonia'. Supposedly a symptom of depression but I'm sure others would affirm that it is a monster of a different kind.

I'd first like to thank you for taking the time to read this. It feels as though I've spiraled to the lowest point in my life. There's much I could say but I'll just bring up a few points.
I feel like an absolute waste of space. I've suffered loneliness and depression since middle school. When I first spoke to a counselor, she noticed some scars, so I was Baker acted at 13. My only memories of high school consist of quiet tears on the bus ride, sitting alone at lunch, and missing days because my anxiety grew unbearable. I've ruined my relationships. I possibly have BPD, but can't say for certain unless I get a professional diagnosis. I only had one or two friends growing up and I'm not entirely sure why they've stuck around. I nearly lost one of them because I felt like too much of a burden to keep in contact during a time I should have. Everyone I meet reminds me of how insufferable I am. I'm truly undesirable and unnoticeable. People forget I'm in the room. No one cares about what I have to say. When I build up the courage to speak, it's only followed by regret. I say all the wrong things and make a fool of myself if I talk and when I don't I'm too quiet/weird/boring. 
I've messed up every good thing in my life. When I try to make things better, I just end up in a worse position than before. I feel like I'm made up of poison. I'm constantly on the verge of tears. My coworkers either tolerate me or clearly dislike when I'm around. I try to stay out of their way yet I'm often yelled at or used as an emotional punching bag. I'm always under pressure to not make any mistake or they'll resent me even more. They have every right to honestly. I think everyone resents me once they get to know me. I wish I never existed. My parents deserved better than me. My partner could easily do better, the way he looks at me breaks my heart. I only see him genuinely happy and enjoying himself with anyone else. When it's just me and him, I always question why he's wasting his time. I think if he had a little more confidence, he'd realize he could have any girl he wanted. Someone he can truly bond with. Someone who will offer more than I could ever dream of. 
My heart has been aching for a long time. At the end of the day, there is nothing to love or remotely like about me. I've been terrible because of my distrust, insecurities, and anger. I detest myself. My lack of a personality combined with grotesque appearance and worthless soul. I don't know who I am anymore. I've only ever felt others' disgust towards me. That's all I've experienced to be true. I was Baker acted a second time when I relapsed and needed stitches. A few years down the line and here I am. I don't have many fun memories or can look back to a time when things were better. My sadness has weighed heavier each day for as long as I can remember. I live like a robot now. Days blend together. Work, sleep, school. Lay in bed on my days off. Cry at work, cry to sleep. I'm almost 25. I don't have a license. I've never looked forward to a weekend. I forget there's a world out there full of life and people who are always experiencing so much. I just waste away at home with no one and nowhere to go. The few times I've been to places with my partner, I just end up breaking down because I can't bear this sadness anymore. I can't escape this misery. I'm either in a state of panic with an aching pain in my chest, suffocating and nauseous from crying so much or I'm simply numb and hollow until my breaking point again. That's my life's cycle. It feels like I'm drowning and I just won't die.

Anyway, thanks again for getting this far. This post turned out longer than I anticipated. I know I didn't provide many details. I'm only comfortable with sharing as much as I did.

A lot of the times I can ''not care'' about other people and their opinion, but once I try to open up and do something about my social anxiety, the realization how worthless I am hits me like a train. 

I don't know how to have friends because I'm a boring person who has very little in common with the ''normal'' people. I constantly feel like I have to put on a mask and a bad act to hide my worthlessness, but people quickly see through it, notice I'm 'strange'' and keep away from me which again fuels my view that I'm inadequate. It's a vicious circle. 

I would love to fit in, keep conversations, etc but I don't know how / majority of topics bore me. Plus when I talk, the others stop listening after one second or I just get talked over immediately. When I address the issue, people are just annoyed by my presence. 

I'm not autistic or anything the like. Just suffered from social isolation and consequently socially inept. 

I did meet few people that conversing with works, but those usually see my enthusiasm as a bad sign and stay away.
At the same time, if it did work, I get scared to become friends and then experience us losing the connection or me being even more unskilled next time. It pressures me and I tend to avoid it.

Musashi Miyamoto says &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t regret your choices in life&amp;quot; but no matter how much advice I listen to or take, how many books or podcasts I consume, I can&amp;#39;t apply anything and I keep regretting being born every minute. Everything is so hard, I just want to give up before even trying it, and that makes me feel even shittier because I lose time and don&amp;#39;t have anything valuable to my name because I can&amp;#39;t get myself to do anything that requires even the most minimal amount of effort. All I want to do is browse the internet meaninglessly and stop breathing one day so I don&amp;#39;t have to do anything ever again and can disappear in peace, not troubling anyone anymore. I fucking hate this feeling of anhedonia, I will gladly accept any other symptom of depression but this one is the fucking worst. It destroys any link you have with the world and yourself, it makes you stop giving a shit about important things which you know you must do but can&amp;#39;t be bothered because you don&amp;#39;t even care about your basic survival functions anymore. I really hate this, I just wish I could go back in time and make myself not get depression. I really don&amp;#39;t know how some of you manage to hold down a job, find a committed partner, actually *do* things despite being depressed. I really can&amp;#39;t and I really don&amp;#39;t know how I can get myself out of this shitty feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm 14M and the past year 2020 for me especially april/may-february has been a clusterfuck and the worst part is after the whole thing not while it was happening. Ever since february (when I started severly ruminating about the year before)  all I could think of the whole day was what I haven't done last year and how much better everything would be if  last year I did what I fucking want to now. I'm not going to be publics about it, but last year I had one interest I would spend all day on. I was somewhat depressed because I had a lot of fights with my parents april and one involved the cops getting called and they came to my house, starting saying I need to change and be fixed (I didnt want to )and  I think that basically changed most of my life. After that my main interest it took over my life after that I didn't talk to my parents and I spent all the time in my room. It was covid as you probablyt know so I couldnt do anything. All the time I spent was alone in my room. But that's just some background info. Now the main thing is my rumination of what I could've done in May-august 2020 aka when it was before 8th grade school but I had all free time. The thing I liked then  was all I spent my time on. I'm just going to say it it was hip hop/rap music, thats all I cared about then but the thing is all I did was fucking argue about it on the youtube comments and dumb ass shit like that. Then in september school started and I stated to want to have more interests and passions but then for some reason I didnt I guess and stuck with it. I barely remember anything from september-december 2020 even though I remember stuff a whole year and more before that perfectly. In february I started being more interested in another interest/passion/hobby film/tv and then other types of music. Which is 2 hobbies a much wider variety. I also just wished I would had other interests hobbies. From feb-now that's all I could think of, how I wish my interests/hobbies were different when I had the time. There are moments, usually spanning a few days, where I think forward and more positive. But 98 percent of the time from feb-now all I can think of is how I wish I just went back to may or so 2020. I just fucking hate that I can never get that time back and I wasted it all on something I show a bit of interest I don't want to do at all. I look at other stories of depression and feel jealous that they had more than one inerest or had any interests at all.  I just can't fucking explain it. I know I have my whole life ahead of me but then fucking high school, is starting and I wish I could be happy for it but now all I want to do is skip freshman year and go next year or just pretend I'm 13 and that I'm turning 14 next year and forget everything about last year or pretend I was born a year after I was. I wish life was that way. I just typed the first things on my mind because I can't think straight for some reason. I hope at least one person would understand this paragraph though.  I cant fucking  cope with my constant interest changes too because I was always that type of person to switch main inteerests every 5 or so months but no obsession I had has been as severe as the one to what i liked in 2020 the worst moment the one I wish had changed. I like something different now and I wished that was what my obsession was, not what it actually was. Better yet I could've been a normal person and what I was before then and had more than 1 interests at once.  .Anyways I just need to stop ruminating about the fucking past it is driving me crazy thats all Ive been doing 24/7 for the past 5/6 months I cant take it. . Every singe thing I see reminds me of it and I cant fucking take it.Therapy doesnt work all thereapists/psychologists mock me for thinking about the past and say that it isnt that bad just fuck you how did you get hired all they do is tell me to stay in school even though the shool system is fuking shit and for what I want to be when I grow up 1/50th of what they teach in school matters for it. 

The reason my writing was so sloppy is because everyone I tell the story to they all mock me and say that my life is ahead of me and I should stop worrying and just instead of thinking about he past do those things now even though I fucking hate how I fucked up time and my life.

I can tthink straight or tell this story straight I told it the most straightforward way I could and it still is a mindfuck comprehending what I can say. I just have so much on my mind.

Id also rather have people say what my problem is then tell me just how to get over the past (most other people I see that have trobule getting over the past have a completely different problem of it than I do This is a throwway for obvious reasons since it would be an embarrasment to my main account that I put this on there.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know this is sloppy but bare with me:&lt;/p&gt;

You know when people tell you “just suck it up, it’s going to get better”, or at least something like that.

Yeah, that was me about seven months ago when I was trying to decide on wether or not to just end everything on my eighteenth birthday. 

Clearly, I’ve decided to stick around to see what could happen, maybe things would get better? 

Yk hope for the best… but it’s only gotten worse.

Funny to be honest, at least for me, I believed that if I just gave everyone a chance again, everything would get better. But it hasn’t, some people “changed” but they’re still the same.

My mother still treats me like something she needs to fix. My brother doesn’t even respect me as a person half the time. My father sees me as a burden and apparently my stepmother is jealous of me. 

I can only imagine what would’ve happened if I had gone through with it that night. 

Would they have been devastated like they claim? Or just blame me… like they always have. 

I’ve told my family about my self diagnosed depression. And I guess it is all in my head. Like my mother said “it’s only for attention.”

And yeah, I really should’ve just gone ahead and said my goodbyes that night. If only I could die with no regrets, but I’m not that lucky.

To be honest I was an optimist for the first time in over a decade that night. A part of me lying my to myself to keep me alive and the other part telling me the reality of things, the unfiltered truth I always denied existed.

I should’ve listened to my realty… no one ever truly changes. Especially the ones you want to the most.

I’m not even sure why I write this for strangers to read.

Actually no, I do know.

Because at least here on the internet, no one can laugh in my face and call me a liar.

I am posting here to have a little bit of accountability because I feel like I might need it this month.

I had a really disappointing meeting with my psychiatrist yesterday.  This was our first time meeting in about three months and since we met last, I continued taking my antidepressant but stopped my mood stabilizer.  She was really pissed at me and was being extremely discouraging right off the bat without even asking me my reasoning behind doing so.  Now she wants to put me on another mood stabilizer *sigh*  

I had been on Latuda since I first met with my psychiatrist last September when I suspected I was having a very rare manic episode (I had never been diagnosed bipolar before, but after working in mental health for 15 years and giving it much thought, I decided to address THAT while also finally getting some help for depression that I have been battling here and there unmedicated since I was a teenager).  My doctor put me only on the Latuda saying that it will help stabilize me while also helping with any bipolar depression that pops up.  Welllll the Latuda wasn't cutting it with the depression that sure did show up, and in January while I was more depressed than I could ever remember, I was put on Wellbutrin.  After the combination and feeling only slightly better but still pretty flat, I decided to stop the Latuda to see if maybe it was bringing the antidepressant down.  Coming off of the Latuda was a BITCH.  I had so much anxiety that I NEVER had before, but with my therapist and some time, I made it through to the other side.  I honestly don't feel any differently without it since I stopped in April.

My psychiatrist was trying to tell me that I was feeling better on the combination but I stressed to her that I WAS feeling better than I had in January (my very lowest point!).  Anything would have been an improvement!  She said that I never gave the combination a fair try and that I am not doing enough on my end to help my meds do their job.

Even though I don't like that she was snippy with me about the meds, I know that she is right that I am not always holding up my end of the bargain.  I still drink.  I still smoke weed.  I still don't have the motivation to seek out ways to improve-- exercising, meeting up and connecting with friends and family, etc.  She stressed to me that the meds aren't going to make me just go out and do these things-- they are there to HELP.  I'm a psych nurse, I get it.

Today, I am home from a week vacation where I didn't do myself ANY favors with the drinking and weed smoking.  I haven't done either today since I spent the whole day driving home so I think that I will make this my DAY 1 of trying to stay good.  I would like to see what a month of being good will do for me.  I definitely need to not drink and smoke.  It's going to be SO HARD since my partner also smokes and drinks, but he is supportive and wouldn't make it unnecessarily difficult for me or anything.  I also would like to factor in exercise and keeping in contact with friends/family. 

I'm just tired of feeling like I'm not getting anywhere.  I thought that with meds, managing my depression would be easier! Between meds and therapy, it's been a really rough time.  Anyway, I just thought I would post here to see if anyone has had luck trying to do something like this and how it ended up working out for you.  Maybe I'll post some progress entries along the way.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok.

I know none of you are my therapist, but if you're willing to listen please grant me that. I never had a therapist, nor friends who would care, bar one but they're dealing with their own troubles and have no time for mine.

I turned 22 a little over a month ago and I haven't done a damn thing. I missed out on my formulative years cause I was too busy playing games, watching videos, and panicking whenever I was around people. It was seriously the most pathetic thing. Thing is, I wanted desperately to talk with my classmates and put myself out there. I wanted to be confident, and I never hated a single person around me. Only myself. I was lightly bullied by a lot of people who targeted me for seemingly no reason, other than that I was weak and an easy target.

There's a few instances I still remember, such as when one of my classmates told me ""nobody wants you here"" out on the basketball court during gym class, in front of everybody, and nobody said a thing. Even the teacher ignored it. I stood there, wandering back and forth for about a minute trying to get any kind of attention, but nobody said a thing. I walked back towards the school building, which was a good eigth mile away, visible right from the court. I walked slowly and nobody, not even the teacher stopped me or said anything. That was the first time I felt that alone, that was 7th grade. That year, little stuff happened all the time, but my mind's repressed most of it. I remember though, one time on the bus back home, a bunch of kids were calling out to me from the back. I wish I responded, they went on for a while. I was too scared.

I looked back at all these types of events last week, and I discovered it happened usually once a year with a different person. I'm not one to hold onto that shit, so I forgave them all, especially since it never got too serious, which I'm thankful for. However, I think the mental toll has been paid, and I'm pretty fucked cause of it.

A life of failure and disappointment later, me abandoning people I loved to talk to, me cutting ties, me being lazy and not taking action when I need to, all led to me being here now. A 22 year old nobody, no direction, nobody who will give me an objective, straight answer, no relationship experience, no money, nothing to show and already feeling like I'm in the shoes of a geezer.

I still have my dreams though, so many dreams. Like most other people, I would give so much just for a chance to go back and do it again, but who says it wouldn't just end up the same way? Two of my biggest insecurities were my *name* of all things, and my appearance. I was an ugly kid, a little better off now but not by much. So, realistically, my only choice is to carve forward. Still, I can't talk to people despite trying so, so hard, I have no confidence in myself whatsoever. Seriously, I don't know if it's the mild porn addiction, the lack of support or successes or whatever, but my confidence is through the damn floor. I know I'm self aware in most things, though I'm sure I got a million blind spots too, but the things I see are torturing me endlessly.

I want so many things in life. I want to move to San Francisco, finish off my (planned) last two years of college there, try to put myself out there one last time. I want to spend nights with a small group of friends by the beach and dock, in the city just enjoying life. I want to learn to skateboard. I want to learn Jiu Jitsu to gain some confidence, and to be able to protect myself and others, at least a little. I want to learn to make comics or manga or anything of the sort, and put what I have in mind into reality. I want to further my programming and finish my game I've been working on for the past year. I want to start a YouTube channel so I'd always have people to talk to who were interested in the same stuff as me, so I'd have an outlet to just talk. I want to be more confident. I want to be unreasonably confident. I want to put myself out there every chance I see a positive outcome from, even if it's a gamble. I want to be kind to everybody, regardless of my political beliefs. I want to help people just cause. I want to live an adventurous life. I want to fall in love. I want to start a family, raise 4+ happy kids in San Fran, send them to school and teach them to be strong and wise, and to enjoy their lives.

I'm currently stuck in my mom's house in suburbia, 8k in debt and running my days out as a wagie. I already feel so old. I don't know what to do. I can't hold most conversations. I'm a coward. Everybody's moving ahead in life, except for me.

I feel like others think I&amp;#39;m crazy when I fall into a panic, and she was the only one who knew how bad they really get because she got them too. She never judged me. We got each other through. Now that she&amp;#39;s gone I realize that I have almost no friends and the ones I do have I can&amp;#39;t talk to about what I feel inside because I&amp;#39;m afraid they will think I&amp;#39;m really loosing it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past year I&amp;#39;ve fallen into a deep dark depression. The grief comes and goes. The anxiety is worse than ever.  The panic and paranoia are so real. And I realize I have no one to talk to about it. My husband of 8 years does his best to help me, but my internal struggles have really worn us down. Sometimes I&amp;#39;m so depressed that I can&amp;#39;t feel anything. I can tell he&amp;#39;s frustrated with me, but I have no idea how to move on with my life. I still go to work and carry on as best I can at home. But I feel so alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I move on?&lt;/p&gt;

I know none of you are my therapist, but if you're willing to listen please grant me that. I never had a therapist, nor friends who would care, bar one but they're dealing with their own troubles and have no time for mine.

I turned 22 a little over a month ago and I haven't done a damn thing. I missed out on my formulative years cause I was too busy playing games, watching videos, and panicking whenever I was around people. It was seriously the most pathetic thing. Thing is, I wanted desperately to talk with my classmates and put myself out there. I wanted to be confident, and I never hated a single person around me. Only myself. I was lightly bullied by a lot of people who targeted me for seemingly no reason, other than that I was weak and an easy target.

There's a few instances I still remember, such as when one of my classmates told me ""nobody wants you here"" out on the basketball court during gym class, in front of everybody, and nobody said a thing. Even the teacher ignored it. I stood there, wandering back and forth for about a minute trying to get any kind of attention, but nobody said a thing. I walked back towards the school building, which was a good eigth mile away, visible right from the court. I walked slowly and nobody, not even the teacher stopped me or said anything. That was the first time I felt that alone, that was 7th grade. That year, little stuff happened all the time, but my mind's repressed most of it. I remember though, one time on the bus back home, a bunch of kids were calling out to me from the back. I wish I responded, they went on for a while. I was too scared.

I looked back at all these types of events last week, and I discovered it happened usually once a year with a different person. I'm not one to hold onto that shit, so I forgave them all, especially since it never got too serious, which I'm thankful for. However, I think the mental toll has been paid, and I'm pretty fucked cause of it.

A life of failure and disappointment later, me abandoning people I loved to talk to, me cutting ties, me being lazy and not taking action when I need to, all led to me being here now. A 22 year old nobody, no direction, nobody who will give me an objective, straight answer, no relationship experience, no money, nothing to show and already feeling like I'm in the shoes of a geezer.

I still have my dreams though, so many dreams. Like most other people, I would give so much just for a chance to go back and do it again, but who says it wouldn't just end up the same way? Two of my biggest insecurities were my *name* of all things, and my appearance. I was an ugly kid, a little better off now but not by much. So, realistically, my only choice is to carve forward. Still, I can't talk to people despite trying so, so hard, I have no confidence in myself whatsoever. Seriously, I don't know if it's the mild porn addiction, the lack of support or successes or whatever, but my confidence is through the damn floor. I know I'm self aware in most things, though I'm sure I got a million blind spots too, but the things I see are torturing me endlessly.

I want so many things in life. I want to move to San Francisco, finish off my (planned) last two years of college there, try to put myself out there one last time. I want to spend nights with a small group of friends by the beach and dock, in the city just enjoying life. I want to learn to skateboard. I want to learn Jiu Jitsu to gain some confidence, and to be able to protect myself and others, at least a little. I want to learn to make comics or manga or anything of the sort, and put what I have in mind into reality. I want to further my programming and finish my game I've been working on for the past year. I want to start a YouTube channel so I'd always have people to talk to who were interested in the same stuff as me, so I'd have an outlet to just talk. I want to be more confident. I want to be unreasonably confident. I want to put myself out there every chance I see a positive outcome from, even if it's a gamble. I want to be kind to everybody, regardless of my political beliefs. I want to help people just cause. I want to live an adventurous life. I want to fall in love. I want to start a family, raise 4+ happy kids in San Fran, send them to school and teach them to be strong and wise, and to enjoy their lives.

I'm currently stuck in my mom's house in suburbia, 8k in debt and running my days out as a wagie. I already feel so old. I don't know what to do. I can't hold most conversations. I'm a coward. Everybody's moving ahead in life, except for me.

Every day is the same now.

There is no true variation in the days my life consists of. Hell, even calling it a life is a stretch, because ultimately, I'm not living. I do not feel alive.

I tried confronting people at school. I really did. I tried to converse with people I'd once known to be the fuel to my grand, nightmarish, day-to-day struggle. The result was ridiculing.

Then she up and fucking disappeared, proving to be just as absent as everyone else that ""cared"". As a matter of fact, said abandonment is why I'm here right now. I presented my heart to someone, and she branded it. It genuinely burned.

I don't know how I'd react to praise. I don't know how I'd react to care. I don't know how I'd react to love. Why? Because I've never been able to look one in the eyes and tell it ""I know how you feel"". I want to feel, finally. I've been told to be dismissive of this idea before, but I don't care if I'm ""just a hormonal, confused teenage boy"". I'm a person, too. I can tire and be saddened like everyone else.

we all heard that love is just a chemical reaction that comles animals to breed. but is it tho?

love is when you are at 3 am crying like a fucking baby on the floor cause she broke up with you 

love is when you go to school with that feeling you worth nothing without her.

love is the feeling of waking up in the morning and all you think is about her.

love isnt really just a chemical rection its a lot more then that.

when we love we truly love someone it change that brain chemistry. that really changing you body

love is a strong word beacause when you think you found the one that would be there is the darkest moment of you life they run away with someone.
