###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don&amp;#39;t say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can&amp;#39;t turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  &lt;a href=""http://redd.it/igh87""&gt;Our talking tips&lt;/a&gt; offer more detailed guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs (&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel""&gt;unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon&lt;/a&gt;). People like this &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will typically try to scratch their psychological &amp;quot;itch&amp;quot; by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  &lt;strong&gt;There are&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;more and better choices than &amp;quot;brutally forcing someone to stay alive&amp;quot; or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating an artificial and toxic sense of &amp;quot;solidarity&amp;quot; by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  &lt;strong&gt;Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person&amp;#39;s feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.&lt;/strong&gt;  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; involve persuasion (&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t do it!&amp;quot;), cheerleading (&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve got this!&amp;quot;) or meaningless false promises (&amp;quot;Trust me, it gets better!&amp;quot;), or invalidation (&amp;quot;Let me show you how things aren&amp;#39;t as bad as you think!&amp;quot;).  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it&amp;#39;s fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else&amp;#39;s hope of getting help.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone&amp;#39;s trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.&lt;/strong&gt;  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an &lt;strong&gt;extremely unlikely&lt;/strong&gt; outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in &lt;a href=""http://redd.it/1c7ntr""&gt;our Hotlines FAQ post&lt;/a&gt;). The goal is always to provide all help with the client&amp;#39;s full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch""&gt;let us know discreetly&lt;/a&gt; if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don&amp;#39;t recommend trying to engage with them directly.&lt;/p&gt;

It's essential in the fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and the fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding.  Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL.  

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population.  We used to allow it, until the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming, and, not without regret, we made this rule.  Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our members' wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

It&amp;#39;s essential in the fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and the fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding.  Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But activism just doesn&amp;#39;t work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population.  We used to allow it, until the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming, and, not without regret, we made this rule.  Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our members&amp;#39; wounds, it&amp;#39;s a waste of the activists&amp;#39; time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please report any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that&amp;#39;s mainly about a cause or an issue rather than a request for personal support.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Yeah. That’s what I felt like the whole ordeal. 

In October of 2020, on the 12th, I was in the middle of online class. Honors English, at 10:15 AM, we were reading 1984. My mother sat down next to me, and said unto me:

“So, I’ve just gotten an email from the school.”

“Okay..?”

“It says you googled something relating to suicide.”

“I might’ve.” 

“Do you want to go to the hospital?”

“Not really. I’m in the middle of English.”

“Wasn’t a question.”

We got in the car, and drove to the hospital. I was entered in and they gave me a room at the back of the building. I couldn’t leave it, I didn’t have my phone with me to talk to anyone aside from whichever poor nurse was out there, and I was there until Thursday. Throughout the week my parents visited, and every day after that Monday I constantly asked “When can I leave? I want to go home, I’m feeling much better now.” 

They sent me up on Thursday evening, and hyped me up for it from Tuesday to Wednesday. Like it was fucking Disneyworld. I got into an ambulance, they laid me out on the gurney, and we took the 2 hour boat trip to the mainland. We drove a little to a seemingly nice little place called Pembroke Hospital. I saw it through the little door windows, and assumed I would be there for maybe a day or two. That was the agreement. Give it a try for a day, and we’ll bring you up to Rhode Island, a place I loved and where we were supposed to go anyway. So when we got inside, I noticed the peeling paint and rather unusual smell. Like a rotted food of some kind. They gave me my room (read that as ‘cell’ because it was a room with one barred window, a brick of a bed, and a desk) and the hours passed, and I eventually fell asleep. Friday came, met some of the other poor inmates, and called my mom. During said call a fucking fight broke out. Someone did a fucking Wolverine off the table and dove right onto the other person. I asked when I could leave, and my mother said to ask the doctor. There wasn’t really one, it was predominantly nurses. They gave me a sheet that basically said “You’re here til the doctor says otherwise. Weekends don’t count, chuckles. Enjoy prison.” 

On Sunday I finally saw a doctor, and let loose everything I felt. Funny enough, the doctor learned I felt worse in here than I did at home, or school. Fights every day, the fact I wasn’t allowed sweatpants or sweatshirts so I had to wear shorts and a short sleeved shirt in a New England fall, everything. Here’s a paraphrased transcription. 

“How are you?”

“Worse in here, now let me out.”

“What’s your experience been like in here?”

“Constant fights, mindless elementary school-grade paperwork, and prison food and rooms.”

“Alright. I’ll see what I can do.”

He discharged me Monday. I was picked up at 5 PM, by my mother and uncle, and ate like a starved homeless man a few bags of cheez its and Oreos. When we reached Rhode Island, I finished an entire pizza in 5 or 6 minutes. We saw a regular doctor a day later, and learned I had actually lost weight during my stay. I googled the place at my uncle’s (what used to be my granny’s house, god rest her soul) and learned it was barely cracking 2 stars. Here, give it a read, [they’re a treasure trove of neglect, abuse, discrimination, and plain old stupidity.](https://m.yelp.com/biz/pembroke-hospital-pembroke-2)

I regret it deeply. I should of taken the time to calm down and talk to her rather then just shoving her away but its to late now. I forgot how important she was to me staying mentally connected to this world and with her gone I feel no need to continue. 

The worst part is I see her everyday. As we work at the same job and I talk to her a lot. I think the worst part of it is she actually does not like me anymore. But I wish she would tell me, because all my little heart wants is to spend all its time loving someone else would actually cares about it. And it breaks me to know she probably doesn’t give a shit. But the worst part is im so loyal i cant even open up to anyone else. Its like im stuck in a endless torture. 

I have an inability to make or maintain friendships so I have no one to really talk to about how im feeling or my friends i do have are mentally strained of me talking about how i feel. I keep trying to tell them im suicidal but no one seems to care which doesn’t help with the intrusive thoughts. The past week has been the hardest I get more thoughts frequently and keep contemplating killing myself more and more. i cry when i drive to work and I cry myself to sleep. Ive wanted to kill myself ever since I was a child but people would come into my life who would keep me holding on, but after losing the person I thought i was going to be with for the rest of my life it has utterly destroyed me. Im so fractured I don’t know if i will make it out, i see her everyday. its terrible because all i want is for her to care about me, but she doesn’t so it destroys me. And i should probably be looking for a different job to get away from her but im so destroyed its left me completely useless to anything other then just going on with what I have.

Im also physically sick ontop of it, I have chronic eczema and living with full body eczema is mentally exhausting and i only really wanted to stay alive because of my ex being there and needing me but now im no longer wanted or needed so its very hard, yes i know my family loves me but that isn’t what i want in life.

And somehow i put on a smile and make everyone laugh at work and i seem to be the most positive person but im dying on the inside and its probably the only reason im so funny and nice because its all i can do to stop myself from breaking down

Like I don’t want to die but i hate being alive i hate feeling anything anymore it just hurts so much and im alone, i live alone, I haven’t been alone in so long, i hate being alone, alone with myself, alone with my thoughts, and im not looking for advice i just want some people to hear me. Because i cant say anything to my friends because ill just burden them, im sorry to even burden whos reading this but thank you for just reading.

I guess all i can do is wait and hope time will bring me peace but it’s getting really hard, ive only attempted suicide once when I was like 17-18. I was obviously unsuccessful but idk i got better ideas now. Im just hoping I can talk myself out of it, but I really don’t want to anymore.

I just have never had a heart break, break me so hard, we lived together we slept together we did everything together and now I just work with her and go home alone every night instead of with her. Alone to my ‘home’ that doesn’t even feel like home without someone to spend it with.

And I cannot even get a cat or a dog to spend my home with because im so allergic and my chronic health conditions would get unbearable :/

Maybe im not ready to start dating again but why does every girl have 1-3 cats, like damn. I don’t wanna make anyone get rid of their cats to date me so I just avoid them but like man, really sucks being allergic to shit, slims the options when every woman seems to love cats. Especially because id love to be able to touch cats and dogs :(. 

Okay I’ve typed enough to stop crying thank you for reading, I will probably start crying again but at least I have stopped for 3 mins. I hope whoever you are whos reading this is having a nice day/night. Or maybe my woes made you forget yours.

But the worst part is im so loyal i cant even open up to anyone else. Its like im stuck in a endless torture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have an inability to make or maintain friendships so I have no one to really talk to about how im feeling or my friends i do have are mentally strained of me talking about how i feel. I keep trying to tell them im suicidal but no one seems to care which doesn’t help with the intrusive thoughts. The past week has been the hardest I get more thoughts frequently and keep contemplating killing myself more and more. i cry when i drive to work and I cry myself to sleep. Ive wanted to kill myself ever since I was a child but people would come into my life who would keep me holding on, but after losing the person I thought i was going to be with for the rest of my life it has utterly destroyed me. Im so fractured I don’t know if i will make it out, i see her everyday. its terrible because all i want is for her to care about me, but she doesn’t so it destroys me. And i should probably be looking for a different job to get away from her but im so destroyed its left me completely useless to anything other then just going on with what I have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im also physically sick ontop of it, I have chronic eczema and living with full body eczema is mentally exhausting and i only really wanted to stay alive because of my ex being there and needing me but now im no longer wanted or needed so its very hard, yes i know my family loves me but that isn’t what i want in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And somehow i put on a smile and make everyone laugh at work and i seem to be the most positive person but im dying on the inside and its probably the only reason im so funny and nice because its all i can do to stop myself from breaking down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I don’t want to die but i hate being alive i hate feeling anything anymore it just hurts so much and im alone, i live alone, I haven’t been alone in so long, i hate being alone, alone with myself, alone with my thoughts, and im not looking for advice i just want some people to hear me. Because i cant say anything to my friends because ill just burden them, im sorry to even burden whos reading this but thank you for just reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess all i can do is wait and hope time will bring me peace but it’s getting really hard, ive only attempted suicide once when I was like 17-18. I was obviously unsuccessful but idk i got better ideas now. Im just hoping I can talk myself out of it, but I really don’t want to anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just have never had a heart break, break me so hard, we lived together we slept together we did everything together and now I just work with her and go home alone every night instead of with her. Alone to my ‘home’ that doesn’t even feel like home without someone to spend it with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I cannot even get a cat or a dog to spend my home with because im so allergic and my chronic health conditions would get unbearable :/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe im not ready to start dating again but why does every girl have 1-3 cats, like damn. I don’t wanna make anyone get rid of their cats to date me so I just avoid them but like man, really sucks being allergic to shit, slims the options when every woman seems to love cats. Especially because id love to be able to touch cats and dogs :(. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay I’ve typed enough to stop crying thank you for reading, I will probably start crying again but at least I have stopped for 3 mins. I hope whoever you are whos reading this is having a nice day/night. Or maybe my woes made you forget yours. Anyways thanks for reading some of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

September 2017:   
Body dysmorphia leads me to believe I have gynecomastia. Plastic surgery research occupies most of my time. Turns out to be basically negligible and a case that goes away if I lose weight (learned this much later on).

&amp;#x200B;

December 2017:   
After 6 scheduled (and cancelled) surgery dates with plastic surgeons to remove the gynecomastia, my parents recommend that I see our doctor and talk about depression. I oblige.

&amp;#x200B;

January 2018:   
After my first visit with the doctor, I start taking Zoloft 25mg 1x/day.

&amp;#x200B;

March 2018:   
I up the dosage to 50mg/day. Start complaining to doctor about ""emotional numbness"" and taper back down to 25mg 2x/day.

&amp;#x200B;

April 2018:   
I'm at a bar and get cold clocked (to this day I still do not know who hit me). Clean mandibular fracture and broken in two places. Wired shut for 4 weeks after that.

&amp;#x200B;

August 2018:   
Decide I'm good and that I don't need Zoloft anymore (was also very overweight). Go off the drug and two weeks later, I total my '01 BMW e46 M3 that I bought a year prior after running a stop light I didn't see. T-boned a taxi.

&amp;#x200B;

September 2018:   
Researching that Zoloft weakens bone density and increases risk of fractures by up to 75%. Thought of ""if you weren't on Zoloft, your jaw wouldn't have broken"" starts to grow in my head. call my mom on my birthday, mention suicide for the first time. She says I ""can't leave this earth"" in tears.

&amp;#x200B;

October 2018:   
Meet a new girl, we become boyfriend and girlfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

April 2019:   
I buy a penis enlargement device ""just because"" to see if I can get any bigger for my gf at the time. And mind you, I was not insecure about my size to begin with, I just wanted to see if it could get bigger. I ended up suffering an injury from doing too much, too fast that left my penis in a ""hard flaccid"" state sometimes, and actually lost a bit of length and girth because of it. This leads to a lot of anxiety and depression that I still experience to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

May 2019:   
Depressed, I decide to start Zoloft again. 25mg 1x/day.

&amp;#x200B;

September 2019:   
I go off of Zoloft again. Girlfriend and I break up.

&amp;#x200B;

October 2019 - January 2021:   
Working full-time, met another girl around Feb 2020 that I dated up until recently. Things we just OK. Covid didn't make things any easier, but whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

February 2021:   
I approach a urologist about the potential of Zoloft ruining my sex drive, and that's the reason I can't perform like I used to. I start doing research and come across Wellbutrin. I start taking Wellbutrin 100mg SR 1x/day.

&amp;#x200B;

March 2021:   
I go off of Wellbutrin.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Wellbutrin 100mg/1x per day continues for month-long streaks coupled with about a month off. This cycle repeats itself for about 3 months up until the middle of this past June.

&amp;#x200B;

\- - - - - - - - - - -

End of June 2021:   
I come across a bunch of photos of myself a year or two prior to the gynecomastia/Zoloft phase. Look myself and love what I see. My face looked different. I remember my penis looking and functioning the way it used to. I remember the way my teeth pressed together when I closed my mouth, and how my jaw didn't click everytime I opened it or when I gave my girlfriend oral.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*first scare here\*\* (July 2, 2021):   
I take my father's competition ruger out of the case next to his bed (I'm at my parent's house here). I hold it. I look at it. I wonder... I don't cry or whatever. I try to fight. I try to think about what I can do differently, but nothing really happens. I put the gun back in its case, and I decide to light a bowl and get high. I pass out at the top of my parent's stairs until 2pm in the afternoon. I had off of work, and the rest of the family is at our vacation house, so I was home alone.

&amp;#x200B;

July 3, 2021:   
I decide to do something, so I book a tee time and drop a 72 on 18-holes from the tips here at our home course, with a 33 (-3) on the back nine. Golf is a big passion of mine, and I have my own horror stories of trying to play in college/throughout highschool that I won't get into. I've played golf my entire life.

\- - -

July 4, 2021 (today):   


I wake up, depressed again. Not high this time, but I start reading about people on psychiatric medications and how it can permanently mess them up. I start thinking about everything, from how my dick is fucked up, to how my face looks different from a jaw fracture I suffered because I chose to take antidepressants (and how the SSRIs probably weakened my bone density), how I pissed away good relationships with good women. Everything.  


I go back upstairs and take my Dad's ruger out again. I look at it. This time I cry a little bit. I start to realize I'm unstable and the only thing holding me back is that I really don't know how to operate a ruger, and the magazines are out (though there are bullets in the magazines). I frighten myself again, and put it back in the case. I cry to God a bit here and say ""I'm really having a tough time here man. I don't know what to do.""

This is the most peaceful way to go I could come up with. I'm domestically abused by my mom and there's no way out of this household. The solution might seem obvious, get a job, save money, find a place to live. But the problem is that my mom won't let me move out because, according to our culture, women shouldn't move out of their parents house until they get a husband. She keeps threatening to kill me, get me tortured etc. even though I'm doing my best to appease her. When somebody else makes her mad she lashes out on me and my 3 younger half-sisters, who are basically being raised by me because my mom and step-father don't want to take care of them

Moving out secretly isn't an option either because in order to do that I'd have to have a job, and my mom won't let me get one. I don't even have a bank account despite being on the verge of turning 18. My school noticed that there's something wrong with me because I kept falling asleep in the middle of classes so they made me talk to my school counselor, I told her almosr everything so she contacted some organization that helps troubled young people. They were supposed to help me with moving out but they couldn't do anything, of course they didn't explicitly say that but they told me multiple times that my situation is ""very difficult"", that they're not sure what to do, they even straight up told me that I'm trapped. 

I'm constantly sleep-deprived due to having to take care of my little half-sisters all the time (even at night). I get woken up multiple times during a night because my 2 youngest sisters are VERY small and small children tend to not sleep well. Nearly every night I fall asleep past midnight and get woken up at roughly 6 or 7am.

Not to mention that I can't take a shower or go to the bathroom whenever I need to because my sisters might hurt themselves and/or each other if I take my eyes off of them.

My mom hid MY documents away from me, doesn't let me go out (I have to stay home 24/7, look after my 3 half-sisters and do chores), doesn't care about my education, forces her beliefs on me and physically and psychologically abuses me like I'm not obedient like a fucking dog. My mom isn't even employed, she never works. She either goes out with her friends or lounges at home and does nothing all day. I have no decent future ahead of me. Of course I'm not blaming everything on my mom, I brought some of this upon myself too.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found a way to kill myself, now all I have to do is wait for the occasion; I&amp;#39;m going to get drunk and jump off a bridge into water.

My son was nearly arrested and charged with creating, possessing, and distributing child porn when he was halfway thru 8th grade. This past May, he finished 9th grade.

The only reason he was NOT arrested and charged with these things is because I was able to convince the local PD that he was just trying to find naked pics of girls his own age to fap to. He was 13 at the time. It also helped that he was able to provide valuable intel that got an actual pedophile arrested and saved a fellow 13 year old classmate from being victimized by said pedo.

My husband and I finally relaxed our restrictions on his phone about 6 weeks ago.

On Thursday, I found evidence on his phone that he accessed some of his old child porn collection within the past week. The collection that was in a suspended account 2 years ago, but was somehow back to being 100% available within the last 2 weeks (they turned it into a honeypot to catch pedos).

He's 15 now. This account is not the only recent activity that he's managed to accumulate over the last 2-4 weeks. (He got around the browser restrictions I put in place using Facebook Messenger.  Keep your kids away from that!!!)

Knowing that he has a history of this, and immediately tried to find ways to access this smut the moment he knew he was less monitored leads me to believe that he will be contacted by law enforcement once again.

I can't do this shit again. I have severely debilitating arthritis and a few other conditions.  I have a good life insurance policy that I've paid into so long that, even if suicide is proven, cannot stop the payout. Said payout is just about exactly what we were told would be his legal defense fees 2 years ago. 

My kid seems to truly not care about any of this. I honestly believe he has some sort of mental illness, but his counselor has said the only thing she really suspects is ADHD.

I am diabetic. I am an insulin dependent diabetic. It would be a super simple thing for me to ""accidentally"" mix up my 70/30 insulin with my straight fast-acting insulin. 40 units of fast acting insulin while fasting might just do the trick. 80 (given my extreme memory issues, not too hard to do...I've done it before, but was awake to face the consequences. ) at bedtime would be a simple way to send my blood sugar plummeting into coma / death range.

If I manage to.die in the correct way to ensure my family gets my life insurance, that's  100k that can go toward either paying off our significant debt so my husband can hire a lawyer, or straight toward a legal defense for my son.

Will this fuck up my kid even more? Probably. Do I think he'll be so bad off mentally that he can't find a way to move forward? Not any more so than right this moment.

My kid is somewhat of the psychopath/sociopath that my husband is. He does not show emotion until ot overwhelms him. The detectives from both law enforcement agencies that he was in trouble with were sympathetic to a mother's struggle to control the raging hormones of a newly minted teen. 

Now, he's at the ""try him as an adult"" age, and they'll be gunning for him BIG TIME.

How on earth do I save my idiotic son other than to both give him something super traumatic to grieve along with enough money for his Dad to hire him an excellent defense attorney?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, so here&amp;#39;s everything:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My kid seems to truly not care about any of this. I honestly believe he has some sort of mental illness, but his counselor has said the only thing she really suspects is ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am diabetic. I am an insulin dependent diabetic. It would be a super simple thing for me to &amp;quot;accidentally&amp;quot; mix up my 70/30 insulin with my straight fast-acting insulin. 40 units of fast acting insulin while fasting might just do the trick. 80 (given my extreme memory issues, not too hard to do...I&amp;#39;ve done it before, but was awake to face the consequences. ) at bedtime would be a simple way to send my blood sugar plummeting into coma / death range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I manage to.die in the correct way to ensure my family gets my life insurance, that&amp;#39;s  100k that can go toward either paying off our significant debt so my husband can hire a lawyer, or straight toward a legal defense for my son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will this fuck up my kid even more? Probably. Do I think he&amp;#39;ll be so bad off mentally that he can&amp;#39;t find a way to move forward? Not any more so than right this moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My kid is somewhat of the psychopath/sociopath that my husband is. He does not show emotion until ot overwhelms him. The detectives from both law enforcement agencies that he was in trouble with were sympathetic to a mother&amp;#39;s struggle to control the raging hormones of a newly minted teen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, he&amp;#39;s at the &amp;quot;try him as an adult&amp;quot; age, and they&amp;#39;ll be gunning for him BIG TIME.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How on earth do I save my idiotic son other than to both give him something super traumatic to grieve along with enough money for his Dad to hire him an excellent defense attorney?&lt;/p&gt;

My ex kept calling me and our conversation got more and more complicated and heated, and he ended up telling me I was burning bridges with anyone that cared about me, that I was selfish, that I didn't appreciate anything he had done for me. We broke up over a year ago actually because he drank a lot and would yell at me and make me cry often, but for the last year after our breakup, he's been trying to 'improve' himself and 'repair' things with us, which I haven't really been open to but felt guilty and continued lines of communication with him, which I regret doing because I'm starting to realize that he can be manipulative and makes me feel awful.

I apologize for posting this. I really don’t want to waste anyone’s time, especially when other people have much worse problems then me, but I really want to get this off my chest.

I’m pretty sure I’m a trans mtf, but I don’t think I’ll ever be able to live happily and I go back and forth on being suicidal or just living.

Often times I can go a long time without feeling suicidal at all, but only if I distract myself with escapism.

June was a great month for me. Nintendo had a great E3, the Bluebox conspiracy was fun even though it ended up being nothing in the end, Fortnite started one of the best seasons in recent times, I beat Xenoblade Chronicles, and hung out with friends a bit. Even though I had to avoid anything pride related like the plague I was able to live in my own little world and enjoy myself.

Now for whatever reason my dysphoria is back and I hate it. I want to transition but have no idea how to get a therapist to start the process, and can’t even imagine coming out to my parents/friends due to my fear’s. I often consider coming out to one friend who I know supports trans people, but I can’t bring myself to do it.

Summer is always the worst since everyone is posting bikini pics, and I’m sitting here as an ugly male. 

When I get really down I honestly consider suicide as a viable option, but I don’t think I can go through with it knowing that I’m causing pain for other people, so I just grit my teeth and try not to think about it.

I hate that I either have to somehow overcome the seemingly impossible task of transitioning for a chance of living happily, or have to distract myself so the pain goes away.

Honestly I really hope PlayStation has their game announcement event soon so I can distract myself with something fun.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repost because I forgot the trigger warning last time.&lt;/p&gt;

Seriously don't read this honestly. I'll probably delete it once my self control comes back online tomorrow.

I just cut again for the first time in about 3 months. Last time I cut was in a lockdown treatment center, with a hairclip I broke in half and spent 45 minutes in the bathroom digging at the same spot on my arm until fat started coming out and the nurse took me to the ER for stitches. The hairclip was blunt, the cut was was dirty and jagged and messy, it took a long time, it hurt a lot, and it didn't even really help or make me feel better. And then I felt a whole lot worse because I got dropped acuity levels and put on suicide watch, which made everything a million times worse. 

This time I did it in my bathroom at home with a double edged razor. I did a few shallow practice cuts on my calf since I haven't cut in a while. Then made 3 small cuts on my wrist. Went over them a few times til they were deep enough that I could be satisfied (comparatively still pretty shallow by my standards; probably just shallow styro, not that it actually matters). 

It hurt more than I was expecting. It didn't hurt a lot, but last year when I was cutting a lot and very deeply, I could hit styro in one swipe and barely feel it. This time, even just basically giving myself a papercut with the razor stung. Kinda felt pathetic for that. As I kept going it hurt less and less, especially when I went over the same ones a few times to make them deeper. I also forgot how much I hate blood. They bled more than I was expecting, not a lot by any means, I'm just really impatient when it comes to bleeding; it's my least favorite part of cutting, it's just so inconvenient. 

It still helped, which is kind of fucked. I don't feel anything now - nothing emotionally, and the cuts don't hurt either. Which is good, not feeling anything is a good thing and the reason I cut in the first place. I'm glad it still helps even though it's fucked that it still helps. 

I probably just fucked myself in the ass though; I'm going to a new treatment center on Monday (flying out tomorrow, crashing at a hotel and arriving Monday morning), and them knowing I just cut will mean I'll probably be on closer watch and have less freedom. I hid a few razors in my stuff that they probably won't find, just in case I need them. I feel better just knowing they're there if I need them. 

I started cutting myself when I was 11. I'm 20 years old now; that's almost a decade of cutting myself and that's kind of insane to think about. I've been self harming for longer than that; even as a kid I was scratching myself, giving myself bruises, and pulling out my hair (had to shave my head 'cause of trichotillomania when I was 16. lol I'm a very well-rounded fuckup, fucked in all aspects). 

I've been stuck in a cycle of treatment centers and hospitals for the past year and it's helped in some ways but made things a lot worse in others. I'm just really fucking tired and I don't really have hope that things will ever get better or that I'll ever get better or ever be able to be happy or live as a functioning, content human being and member of society.

Then I left my husband, and it was hard, then it got easier and I had friends and the smiles turned real. 

In early July I've now lost my best friend's, my roommates, I have my babies staying with a friend because I don't want them to see me like this, I've almost attempted suicide 3 times in the last month, I've lost 50 lbs, spiraled into an eating disorder, turned into a dangerous jaded cynical selfish piece of shit, and I can't even recognize myself apart from pictures from three weeks ago, let alone five months ago.

I almost killed myself Wednsday and it was the closest I ever came to guaranteed death, and I talked myself down, and I regret it? I just disappeared for two days, and I get home yesterday, and my best friend's upset his cat got out the night I disappeared and wasn't back yet? I felt like I was going to puke, and I still feel like my stomach is in my chest. How'd I fuck up so badly my best friend is more upset about his cat being lost a couple days than he was that I'm lost right now?

It feels like I never walked out of the woods. It feels like maybe I did fucking die or whatever part of me that actually wanted to live and not just go through the daily motions and survive is just dead? It feels like I'm watching myself from far away as everything I love crumbles, and it feels like I'm witnessing first hand and that I was right, everyone is better off without me. I'm slipping, and I'm slipping so fast I have nothing to hold onto. It honestly feels like I'm watching as people move on from me being in their lives, and I'm not even dead yet. I'm a ghost to everyone I love, and I'm still fucking alive to see it. 

I tried to go for a drive today, and all my music just reminds me of people I loved that are either dead now, or no longer love me. I can't listen to the music of my childhood without hearing the love of my life strumming along next to me and singing so badly while I sang over him. All our favorite alternative songs that used to be comforting are suffocating me now. All the music from the last few years makes me think of my ex husband and the awkward silences on car rides while the radio played a song I didn't have the energy to sing to anymore. Panic! Makes me think of the drives with the man I loved but never had the right to. Pink! Makes me think of the best friend that never came home to me and died on the way home to me instead. All the newest 200 or so songs make me think of the last few months with the best friendship I've ever known, the most my music taste has been expanded I years, and now every single fucking note makes me want to drive the car into a tree and never feel loss again.

I tried to take a few selfies today. I don't recognize myself. I look haunted, and hollow, and fucking empty. I look fucking soulless. Every single part of me that was me is gone and the last time I felt like this was at my best friend's funeral, staring down at her in the casket and everything in my brain screaming at me to walk away, look away, this isn't her anymore. 

This isn't me anymore. I'm not me anymore. I tried to get help last week. I went to the hospital I come back and everything is worse now. I wanted to kill myself last week, and I got help, and it didn't help. It didn't fix me. Nothing can fix me but everyone wants me to be fixed. I went in Tuesday, got out Saturday, and by Wednesday night I'm sitting in the woods holding razors and sobbing while I tried to think of any reason not to just let go. I found a reason, and I committed myself to really REALLY doing it. No more trying cause that leaves room for failing and I can't right? So I dye my hair my favorite hair color that I've kept it for so long to make myself feel better and more like myself, and it doesn't help. It doesn't feel like me. I get home I clean I take my meds I work I accomplish goals I bring my kids home and I feel so much better and my best friend comes home and I ask him if I'm allowed to just hug him and he says no. He still doesn't forgive me. 

I know they're going through things. I know I can't rely on them they can't pour from an empty cup and I'm fucking PROUD OF HIM for making choices in his life FOR HIM even if I don't agree with those choices. I'm proud of my other best friend and roommate for being so fucking strong and brave while her heart is shattered, but I'm not asking them to pour anything. I'm not asking them to fix me. I'm not asking them to guide me, I'm not asking them to let me lean on them, I just wanted them to stand by my side. I wanted anyone to just stand by my side because I can't save me from myself when the only thing that's kept me going for 11 years now is knowing how badly it would hurt the people I love, and now I know it's not true. It was selfish of me to expect them to care when they have their own shit to handle, but I don't care about me anymore and I just desperately need anyone else to. I just wanted to hang out. Go for a drive, listen to music play a video game do ANYTHING to distract myself from the fact that everything I love is systematically falling apart. I wanted to laugh again with the funniest man I've ever met. I wanted to parent my kids again with the best mom I've ever known. I wanted to clean the house with loud music and dance around with the kids surrounding us and sit at the table and maybe have someone to eat with that makes eating feel like less of a daunting task while I'm losing weight so rapidly my doctors are all concerned for my health and safety. Their other friends hang out, but their other friends aren't a fucking basket case like I am. I'm lonely, and I'm empty, and I'm sad, and I'm dejected, and I'm spiraling and self destructing and it's like I'm watching as everyone I love moves on from my loss while I'm still alive. I'm still right here, I feel like I'm made of glass and it's starting to splinter and pretty soon I'll just shatter completely and that will be the end of it.

Every reason I had to stay is crumbling. My kids deserve a mother that's not broken. My friends deserve a friend that isn't too broken to be around. They don't see the pain and the fear and the glass and the way I've turned into someone I don't know and don't recognize they don't see that I'm fucking pounding on the walls trying desperately to break them down and let someone in before I can't save me from myself anymore they just see the attitude and the rejection they don't see that the isolation isn't what I want or need. I don't want to be not home right now. I don't want to be not with my kids right now. I want to be me again. I want to be home and safe and loved and welcomed and I want someone to find me and see ME and see that I'm still alive and I'm still trying when everything in me doesn't want to anymore I'm giving it a chance I'm giving it a try and I'm failing so fucking badly because I'm doing it alone and it's officially the day I decided I'd kill myself if it didn't get better by July 4th. It's independence day. A day of freedom. The 5 year anniversary of my first suicide attempt. Things aren't better. They're worse. They're so much worse and every single day I wake up with hope and every single day I go to bed crying so hard no sound comes out.

heres today what it is now:  
i woke up to tis series of text from him: at 2 and  3 am:        
Don’t wake me up. I repeat. Do not wake me up.     

I’m panicking. My body is so fucked up from earlier that it’s felt like it can’t sleep. My throat started doing this acid reflux sort of thing when I was on the phone. Then my body started hurting. Head started hurting. Got light headed. Since then I’ve been having trouble breathing and I feel wired. I literally have slept 1 hour in the past 2 days. Feel like I’m dying.     

Heart hurts. This relationship is literally killing me    



i knwo this is it.   he will now be leving me. 
.i know i will not survive wihtout him though and i knwo because he left me for 2 years and i stopped eating not by choice, coudl not eat and have permanent damage from it now,it is not his fault. i just couldnt survive was in therapya t the time too, nobody could help. i know what i am in for.

Just debt. When I applied and talked with the psychiatrist to see if I was eligible for the infusions, as most people my age (24) are not eligible, the doctor was shocked at how extensive my medication history was. He said it was like the medication list of a 70 year old, needless to say he said I was eligible 3 times over. Too bad it didn't help. 

Also tried 3 rounds of TMS at some point. No help :(

I see a psychiatrist now who's so good compared to typical ones in my area that he doesnt accept insurance, because he has tons of patients either way. Over 300$/appointment. He's the best psych I've ever had, but it's been about a year and a half and I'm still in this hole.

I have an appointment next thursday that I can't afford, and it'll nearly max out my 5,000$ limit credit card. And I'm not even fucking irresponsible with my money. Or at least when I had money.

I couldn't even hold down a fucking 10$/hr retail job at a small pet supply store. I was one of the best employees, always working hard but smart, but mentally it's such a joke how big of a toll it takes on me, I was having these really serious mental breakdowns once a week.

I used to draw when I was like 14-17 but my passion for that is just completely dead. I grew to hate my art.

The only thing I love is music, and I don't like saying this because I don't want to sound pretentious or whatever but like... it's the one thing I'm actually good at. Composing, improvising, guitar &amp; bass... but I dont think I'll ever be able to share it because I don't know anyone, all my friends have moved to different states and even when I tried to find people to play music with I was just met with indifference or apathy. 

And thats okay. I dont want to force anyone.. I just wish I could share it with people and spread that happiness. Like I wish I had friends I could make a band with. But it's just a pipe dream. I'll probably have to sell my fucking guitar soon.

I can't get through college. I'll never be able to make more than minimum wage, but honestly I can't even hold down a minimum fucking wage job.

I'm just a financial and emotional burden on my mom. She lost her job as a union lawyer (pandemic related) and is now making way less. I try to pay for my own shit but I have almost nothing now. Soon I won't even be able to get my prescriptions.

A couple days ago I was cutting my face open with a pair of scissors. Also all over my arm. I almost never self harm but something just took over me. I wasn't bleeding like crazy or anything, but it definitely looks like a cat mauled me. Had a lot of explaining to do to family.

It doesn't help that I have a pretty bad case of fibromyalgia and doctors don't believe me or take me seriously when I say I'm in excruciating pain because I'm a 24 year old boy who MUST just be a lying junkie trying to get opiates to get high. I just cry after half of my doctor appointments.

I have a sister with a medical MJ card and I tried it about 3 times to see if it helped with pain, all it did was make me paranoid and in more pain. Then 3 weeks later I got drug tested at a pain doctor and marijuana came up and he scolded me and called me a liar and said he wouldn't treat a druggie.

I have no money left. I won't be able to see my doctors, or get my prescriptions. My mom says we'll figure it out, but I know she's struggling like she's never struggled before, and it's just us. If I was gone it'd break her heart. But I find endless reasons to rationalize how much better it'd be for others if I was gone. Im such a fucking burden

I was the 'planned' child. I was the one who was supposed to go to college and be successful. I'm named after my father, who I have no relationship with, but he was the 'smart' one among his siblings. I'm not stupid, but I can't even take 2 college classes without fucking breaking down and barely passing.

I can rarely think straight now a days because I'm always in pain. And always mentally hurting. I should just kill myself, it just echoes in the back of my head.

Prior to our relationship i have always had problems with my mental health. I didn’t want to hurt her, i truly didn’t because i do love her. She says I don’t and everybody says if you’re an abuser you dont but ik i love her. Shes the sweetest girl, so smart, so beautiful, respectful, so unique, and very very loving. From where im from (nor cal) young people my age are acting grown and not respecting themselves (boys and girls) but she had so much respect for herself and no girl is like her or even similar. I try to convince my self that im over her bc its been so long but im not. She took me back after fucking up so many times and yet i kept doing it. She got tired of it. I’ve been molested, made fun of all my life, have been emotionally abused since childhood, but my mental health should not be an excuse for why i did what i did. She says im a bad person, and so do a lot of people and i agree. Im a horrible human being who doesn’t deserve anything good in life. Just the accumulation of trauma and the loss of my first love is unbearable. Im too overwhelmed and i feel so alone. Every damn day is just the fucking same now, wake up, smoke, play the game, nap, smoke, play the game and repeat and i really really really wanna end this cycle. Ik its my fault i feel this way and i deserve it for hurting one of god’s precious angels. I go to sleep every night wishing i die in my sleep.
help me
please&lt;/p&gt;

I really cannot wrap my head around school stuff-i get 3s in my mock exams, i always get the lowest in my friend group, i cant keep my concentration up for any longer than 10 mins when revising, teachers dont help, the school doesnt tell us when our mock exams actually are. 

I have no day where i am not stressed about something, whetehr thats my future, the past or the present. I mainly worry about failure-i dread a life where i cannot own my dream cars, my dream homes etc. I literally cannot be poor, working class or middle class as everything i enjoy involves a fuck tone of money.

All i want out of my life is to be in F1, i dont want anything else. Racing is what im born to do, but since im born poor its essentially impossible ill ever make it to f1 and that scares me. All im good at is racing, and all i enjoy is driving. Im very good at it to, i can make a career out of it but i dont have £20 million pounds for all the juniour open wheel legues so ill probably never get the recocnition i deserve.

School wise, im stupid. I put effort in, i get no reward. 

so, i wonder whats even the point of living. i mean i aint good at school, nor do i have the funds to make a career out of something i enjoy-so what is left for me? a supermarket job or some other low payinmg hell hole? im probably gonna cut it short soon if it stays the way it is, i genuienly have no hope. If only i was born rich man, id be able to do what makes me happy-race cars. But no, i gotta study some bullshit poems or some other lesson i couldnt care less about. 

I just dont wanna live anymore-i cant live a normal life-i cant but it seems thats how its gonna work out. I pray that im reading this in 6 years while getting ready to go to silverstone to race for Williams in f1, oh do i beg but its probably not gonna happen and if it doesnt ill have nothing left.

life aint fun when you enjoy expensive hobbies but born poor. I beg for the FIA  to make this sport more accesible, but until that date ever comes i have no hope. I dont even think ill live long enough to see it happen.

From 16-25, I had this excessive stress psychosis thing. I got diagnosed with schizo. Took endless pills and it never helped.

Started to meditate at 25. And it suddenly worked and helped lots.

The way I feel just goes back to hellish. Over and over.

I just hate the systems.

I hate people one-upping each other.

I hate the constant subtle causing of pain. Constant dominating of others for such a vain and pitiful reason.

I hate the ignorance in the world.

And I hate how void and empty it seems.

Despite all of this, I've never hurt anyone. I've always held back, but even that avoidance is coming to fucking bite me.

I'm compulsive. I'm tired. I'm stressing myself out no matter what I do.

It's just emptiness, and I don't want it. I don't want to feel any of it.

I also hate how fake people are. Esp. on reddit. I don't think anyone realizes that anger and hate are very much alive and excused here. It always gets its way. You can't actually stop an emotion from expressing itself, especially if you don't pay attention to it. It's like a bill you have to pay or go to jail for whatever you've committed.

I don't know, again, I will delete it if you tell me to

&gt;So, I am 17. I have severe anxiety which I think evolved into agoraphobia, I don't have a diagnosis because I have obviously never gone to a psychiatrist because mental health is a myth in my country (Romania, if you're curious). Also, depression and ocd probaly. I have always said I either have 7 disorders or one that's as bad as 7. I'm not self-diagnosing, just guessing because I have no other choice lol.  
&gt;  
&gt;Because of my mental health I just couldn't go to school since about november. Like, literally couldn't because my anxiety made me freeze in fear every time I thought about it. At first, it was online and i just stood there staring at the screen for hours not being able to just press the button to enter the meeting. I rarely could enter but just leaving it on and going into the other room to have my panic attack in peace. The fact that my romanian language teacher verbally abused me several times probably has something to do with it too. Then, when in-person school started, it was even worse. I never went to school but it was always on my mind. Never-stopping anxiety. I also only left the house once a month or so to go to the dentist or other doctor.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, I SOMEHOW was able to finish the year with grades from assignments to all the subjects, but, you guessed it, romanian, because the pos abusive teacher also refused to mark my assignments as done becasue I wasn't at school. Now, they're saying I have to go to school on tuesday to have some kind of oral evaluation WITH THAT TEACHER. I just straight up said I couldn't. I physically cannot make me walk there because I will have a huge panic attack and probably feel like I'm dying on the street. I cannot do it. It feels like making a sexual abuse survivor go back and be abused one more time (I am really sorry if this is disrespectful tu sexual abuse victims, but that's how it feels, you can't compare abuse).  
&gt;  
&gt;So, now my abusive parents (I can't even go into this subjects, they're horrible people and I'm pretty sure they're narcissists, though obviously I'm not a doctor) threaten me with kicking me out of the house because, in their words, ""you're so ungrateful, have you ever thought about all the sacrifices we've made for you (they literally did nothing, they barely even gave me food, made me ""work for it"" and with shelter, well we live in a ONE ROOM APARTMENT so yeah, not blaming them for this, but for being so entitled without even a base for it), we won't let you laugh in our face and abandon school, you will get out of our house if you do this"". So, I guess it had to happen eventually, they're also raging homo/transphobes and I am both gay and non-binary, and they would have definitely kicked me out if they found out, but I guess they found another reason to do it.  
&gt;  
&gt;So I really don't know what to do. My life savings amount to about 1 thousand dollars (again, Romania, they also kept my government allowance or whatever it's called), I have no family, no friends that could ever take me in, a mental state too fragile to ever get a job, so it really feels like the only option is dying. This is the end of the road for me. Not trying to be dramatic, though I am suicidal I never thought of actually doing it, but I see no way out of this situation. So, yeah, I really don't know what to do. I am really sorry if this is not appropriate for this sub, tell me where else to put it and I'll delete it from here if it's not. Also, sorry for the rant-y and victimizing tone, that's just me i guess lol. Thank you for reading this, even if you don't know what to say, it still means A LOT. Thank you guys","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I wrote this thing in the assistance subreddit but it was probably a bad sub choice because the mods took it down lol I can&amp;#39;t blame them it&amp;#39;s a really annoying post anyway but maybe you guys can put up with it cause you will relate to it on some extent?

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I am 17. I have severe anxiety which I think evolved into agoraphobia, I don&amp;#39;t have a diagnosis because I have obviously never gone to a psychiatrist because mental health is a myth in my country (Romania, if you&amp;#39;re curious). Also, depression and ocd probaly. I have always said I either have 7 disorders or one that&amp;#39;s as bad as 7. I&amp;#39;m not self-diagnosing, just guessing because I have no other choice lol.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of my mental health I just couldn&amp;#39;t go to school since about november. Like, literally couldn&amp;#39;t because my anxiety made me freeze in fear every time I thought about it. At first, it was online and i just stood there staring at the screen for hours not being able to just press the button to enter the meeting. I rarely could enter but just leaving it on and going into the other room to have my panic attack in peace. The fact that my romanian language teacher verbally abused me several times probably has something to do with it too. Then, when in-person school started, it was even worse. I never went to school but it was always on my mind. Never-stopping anxiety. I also only left the house once a month or so to go to the dentist or other doctor.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I SOMEHOW was able to finish the year with grades from assignments to all the subjects, but, you guessed it, romanian, because the pos abusive teacher also refused to mark my assignments as done becasue I wasn&amp;#39;t at school. Now, they&amp;#39;re saying I have to go to school on tuesday to have some kind of oral evaluation WITH THAT TEACHER. I just straight up said I couldn&amp;#39;t. I physically cannot make me walk there because I will have a huge panic attack and probably feel like I&amp;#39;m dying on the street. I cannot do it. It feels like making a sexual abuse survivor go back and be abused one more time (I am really sorry if this is disrespectful tu sexual abuse victims, but that&amp;#39;s how it feels, you can&amp;#39;t compare abuse).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, now my abusive parents (I can&amp;#39;t even go into this subjects, they&amp;#39;re horrible people and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure they&amp;#39;re narcissists, though obviously I&amp;#39;m not a doctor) threaten me with kicking me out of the house because, in their words, &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re so ungrateful, have you ever thought about all the sacrifices we&amp;#39;ve made for you (they literally did nothing, they barely even gave me food, made me &amp;quot;work for it&amp;quot; and with shelter, well we live in a ONE ROOM APARTMENT so yeah, not blaming them for this, but for being so entitled without even a base for it), we won&amp;#39;t let you laugh in our face and abandon school, you will get out of our house if you do this&amp;quot;. So, I guess it had to happen eventually, they&amp;#39;re also raging homo/transphobes and I am both gay and non-binary, and they would have definitely kicked me out if they found out, but I guess they found another reason to do it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I really don&amp;#39;t know what to do. My life savings amount to about 1 thousand dollars (again, Romania, they also kept my government allowance or whatever it&amp;#39;s called), I have no family, no friends that could ever take me in, a mental state too fragile to ever get a job, so it really feels like the only option is dying. This is the end of the road for me. Not trying to be dramatic, though I am suicidal I never thought of actually doing it, but I see no way out of this situation. So, yeah, I really don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I am really sorry if this is not appropriate for this sub, tell me where else to put it and I&amp;#39;ll delete it from here if it&amp;#39;s not. Also, sorry for the rant-y and victimizing tone, that&amp;#39;s just me i guess lol. Thank you for reading this, even if you don&amp;#39;t know what to say, it still means A LOT. Thank you guys&lt;/p&gt;

# Context:

I'm a 21 years old guy who lives in Europe in a confortable coutry and I have parents that loves me a lot and no brother, sister or family. I'm an extrovert and I have depression (probably sever depression). I have passions (playing music, anime/manga, sports, judo, ...), I don't smoke anything or do drugs and I will never, I don't drink alcool and I will never too. And if it could help I'm an atheist.

# Relationships:

I have always had functional relationships that time has eroded. I have a best friend now even so I'm skeptical. I was the type to be friends with the whole class or the sports club, to quickly become friends with my kindness which people abused. Now I am no longer nice but I have found that socially things are going well even though I had fun doing a tour of all my social networks to find that my relationships are failing. I only have a friend and a few acquaintances whereas before that was not the case. The reason: I was traumatized and betrayed. I have been through tough things in relation to things, scams, people who have abused or harassed me when I had finally considered them as friends or even almost killed myself in cold blood. THE WORST is that it's total, I found something horrible that was done to me on almost every person. It saddens me and makes me lose hope in this principle that relations are becoming more and more arbitrary with social networks on top of that. After all that and all these lies and betrayals that I never experienced at such a young age, how can I believe that? Even my best friend, I don't give him that steadfast trust anymore because I just can't.

But it's not just on the point of friendship that I no longer trust and that I'm broken. On love I have not experienced anything directly but the little that I have seen, the experiences of my relatives and the discrepancy that there is between me and society (I am looking for seriousness only and lasting at 21 years old). and I want to build a functional long-term thing). Not to mention my paranoia which means that I will never trust anyone again. Let us add this to the deceptions, betrayals or even cases that people take as a couple. The responsibility versus the risk that it brings versus the few bonuses that it gives; make me say it's not worth it at all even though it was something I believed a lot.

# Traumas:

About the family I am happy to have parents who love me but they are seriously ill. My mother had a liver transplant and a coma in 2011, she has multiple sclerosis and in April 2021 she caught COVID-19 which almost killed her. On the other hand, my father is very old (63 years old), he is blind in one eye, has severe problems with his legs and lungs (from which his father died). I was inked in my head that they will die when I will be young and now that my mother has almost died it is inked. Especially since their condition worsens visibly. Of course, I didn't have any other family. From my father's side it's ultra negative and it went to justice (they had to kill me, threatened me, harassed and hit me) and my mother's side is rather neutral and classic (so that unnecessary formalities). I am touched by this, but now I become more and more apathetic in general about the suffering of others.

I was harassed in elementary school. IT'S VERY CLASSIC but seriously, it was violent. It was supposedly because I liked Pokémon. In reality it was because they thought I was gay over a misunderstanding and harassed me for it + I don't have big brothers to defend me. So daily fight, pugilla in the morning and in the evening almost KO. The teachers were there too. They ridiculed me and said of me (who was an HP) that I was a dark fool without coming over and over. It got inked in me to the point of making me completely lose confidence in myself. I was friends with my bully on top of that. Nothing was going even outside of school the reputation of being a Pokémon fan was spreading. In short, it still sticks to me this thing with Pikachu Pikachu.

During adolescence the bullying subsided but I was too nice and idle. People have taken advantage of me like never before. I was the nice and athletic geek so easy to become his friend to be friends with the others then the kicker of the group. It often happened like that but I spoke about relationships above.

One of the worst years of my life was 2018. I learned that a very good friend I had made had committed suicide and I missed my school year for the first time in my life. BUT the biggest event was the death of my cat. He only lived 6 years and we did everything to offer him a good life, calm and calm. But he died of a stroke because saliva was in his lungs. He died in excruciating pain and it was overnight and I hoped in vain to save him. I had a very close relationship with him, he was a full member of my family. But as I write this block I realized that maybe it was I who made the situation worse. My cat already had basic heart problems and like an idiot I decided to play with the laser with him for the first time (a month and dust before his death) and he got into it very intensely. I stopped but I noticed that he drooled. Basically I lost a loved one but I feel like I'm a little at fault and it destroys me. Nevertheless it was sudden and my cat did not do it again and for a month and a half everything was calm then from one night to the next he could not walk any more then the stroke occurred. Basically I know it's not me because I spoke to the vet and confirmed this to me, but the loss of my cat means that I have consequences. In 2018 I had suicidal tought, and I only wanted things to stop and be happy.

I had a very bad experience with the first confinement because I saw one of my passion get lost and full of illusions and my inocence that I was determined to keep disappearing. I lost loved ones, people betrayed me even more and I saw the state of a world and a society totally in shambles. I don't care about other people's happiness, I just want to be happy. IN ADDITION during this confinement I lost access to the internet completely so my days were devoted to total introspection and looking at the walls because I had nothing else to do literally.

# This year:

I was in a big depression from 2016 to 2018 until I discovered a game that got me out of it, Super Smash Bros Ultimate. I loved the E Sport competition on it and meeting its players. I wanted to live on it naively and confinement took that away from me and PAF we discover that the majority of players are pedophiles. I was disgusted and inflicted and I fell back into severe depression (because the confinement was hard). So I started studying but by constraint because I didn't have time to research because I was cut off from everything.

In addition, one of my best friends who now is just a lambda friend screwed me. I further realized that my relationship with him was despicable and toxic and that he helped make me believe that I was stupid and incompetent when I was very far from it. People also inked me that I was ugly as a tuna.

I managed to go beyond and finally find a passion: music. I have been playing the piano for 10 years but following complications I had to stop for 2 years. So I got into the guitar. And suddenly my goal was to make music for video games (the one that transcends me so much). As you can imagine regaining my confidence, having the wisdom gained from my experiences, a clean and healthy lifestyle and a goal. I was motivated to start other studies again next year. Could nothing go wrong?

My life is a huge joke. I literally chained one serious event per week from March to now. The almost death of my mom, the university which forgot to press the validate button and I had to call them 187 times (it's real), my piano finally bought at 1500 € which decides to no longer work (even if I finally fix it), the passions and cultural licenses that I love which just become null and void or which no longer correspond to me, realizing that my life is a total relational failure. Imagine having a day of constantly calling a university and telling yourself that you are going to play some music to rest and then the bug thing. Even if it is solved it is just insupportable. I also had problems with my online friends and found out that one I was close to (7-8 years of friendship) was a pedophile. In short, in just 3 months I went from the best, from the top to the bottom. I continued to eat clean, play sports and my passions but now I have a breakdown. I don't feel anything anymore, I have become more aggressive and colder. Life disgusts me and nothing is going and has never been in my direction. I'm just fed up with life and wish it would end, at least just be happy.

&amp;#x200B;

# In the end:

My goals and objectives, my future studies, the desire to have friends and keep my friends, the desire to be happy and to exercise my passions, ... Nothing is there anymore. I am empty, yes I am going to laugh sincerely or be slightly carried away by something but that will not go further. I talk about my problems around me but it's so futile. I see a psychiatrist but he is as useful as a wet sock. By just listening to me, telling me trivialities and telling me why not try the anti-depressants (which I refuse to take and I will not develop why). It's just without appeal. I no longer have hope and basically I don't want to have hope, hope is betrayal and a self-destructive mechanism. At 21, I'm already jaded like an 80-year-old. I had plans this summer, restaurants, trips, activities and even see a cat bar for example (because despite the death of my cat I still love animals). But these days I don't want to. I have commitments already made but I don't want to make them, I don't want to do anything. I have the impression that I would end my life alone in homelessness without anyone.

I am also someone who takes the lead so good. What good is studying next years in a vacuum, what good is continuing my musical project (which is based on the use of Discord this demonic software) or even playing or other.

I wanted to try my madeleine de prouste like an old game or anime but I don't have the motivation for it. I don't want nothing but I only want to be happy. I'm tired and the only think keeping me alive is the feer of death and and the will of life. The only think that stimulate me is music.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi I wanted to say sorry for my bad English at first and secondly I don&amp;#39;t have suicidal thought but it&amp;#39;s very similar in a certain way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, one of my best friends who now is just a lambda friend screwed me. I further realized that my relationship with him was despicable and toxic and that he helped make me believe that I was stupid and incompetent when I was very far from it. People also inked me that I was ugly as a tuna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to go beyond and finally find a passion: music. I have been playing the piano for 10 years but following complications I had to stop for 2 years. So I got into the guitar. And suddenly my goal was to make music for video games (the one that transcends me so much). As you can imagine regaining my confidence, having the wisdom gained from my experiences, a clean and healthy lifestyle and a goal. I was motivated to start other studies again next year. Could nothing go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My life is a huge joke. I literally chained one serious event per week from March to now. The almost death of my mom, the university which forgot to press the validate button and I had to call them 187 times (it&amp;#39;s real), my piano finally bought at 1500 € which decides to no longer work (even if I finally fix it), the passions and cultural licenses that I love which just become null and void or which no longer correspond to me, realizing that my life is a total relational failure. Imagine having a day of constantly calling a university and telling yourself that you are going to play some music to rest and then the bug thing. Even if it is solved it is just insupportable. I also had problems with my online friends and found out that one I was close to (7-8 years of friendship) was a pedophile. In short, in just 3 months I went from the best, from the top to the bottom. I continued to eat clean, play sports and my passions but now I have a breakdown. I don&amp;#39;t feel anything anymore, I have become more aggressive and colder. Life disgusts me and nothing is going and has never been in my direction. I&amp;#39;m just fed up with life and wish it would end, at least just be happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;In the end:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goals and objectives, my future studies, the desire to have friends and keep my friends, the desire to be happy and to exercise my passions, ... Nothing is there anymore. I am empty, yes I am going to laugh sincerely or be slightly carried away by something but that will not go further. I talk about my problems around me but it&amp;#39;s so futile. I see a psychiatrist but he is as useful as a wet sock. By just listening to me, telling me trivialities and telling me why not try the anti-depressants (which I refuse to take and I will not develop why). It&amp;#39;s just without appeal. I no longer have hope and basically I don&amp;#39;t want to have hope, hope is betrayal and a self-destructive mechanism. At 21, I&amp;#39;m already jaded like an 80-year-old. I had plans this summer, restaurants, trips, activities and even see a cat bar for example (because despite the death of my cat I still love animals). But these days I don&amp;#39;t want to. I have commitments already made but I don&amp;#39;t want to make them, I don&amp;#39;t want to do anything. I have the impression that I would end my life alone in homelessness without anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also someone who takes the lead so good. What good is studying next years in a vacuum, what good is continuing my musical project (which is based on the use of Discord this demonic software) or even playing or other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to try my madeleine de prouste like an old game or anime but I don&amp;#39;t have the motivation for it. I don&amp;#39;t want nothing but I only want to be happy. I&amp;#39;m tired and the only think keeping me alive is the feer of death and and the will of life. The only think that stimulate me is music.&lt;/p&gt;

He has not worked since last March. He’s tried a few things but they have not worked out and that has made him progressively feel worse. He’s in the middle of another job not working out. He thinks it will but it’s not because he missed several deadlines. 

He’s had bad depression for a long time but will not get help and will not talk to me about it in any form. I only know because I monitor his search history because I was worried something was off and now I monitor it for when he searches suicidal things. 

He’s back to searching again. Many of the “I’m ready to be done” “I’m tired” and  things like that. In the not too distant past he has  written a suicide note that I found and I think this has been going on for years. I don’t mention it because I’m afraid he will just hide it even better and then I’ll never know. 

It’s honestly all too much for me and he is so unwilling to communicate with anyone I don’t know what to do. 

I know looking at his search isn’t good, but it’s how I feel I can keep him safer. 

His sleep is so messed up. He goes to sleep at 6-8am and sleeps all day and then takes more naps. It’s been like this for over a year now with his bed time getting later and later.

I also think I made him feel really bad two days ago. He refused to go do a pee test before they closed and it was the deadline for when he had to do it by for the job. I was upset and I said it hurt me that he wouldn’t do this simplest thing to ensure his job was secure when I’ve been working hard for the last year and a half and I just didn’t get how he couldn’t be willing to do the simplest thing.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been with my bf for 11 years now.

I hate it here. Always have. 

Most of my life has been nothing but anxiety, loathing, depression, insecurity, and this still lingers to this day. As a child, I was raised by a single mother after my father bounced and left us to fend for ourselves. I was abused by authority figures, raped, mugged, beaten, robbed, and seen some really bad things. 

As an adult, I have seen nothing but bullshit artists, abusive partners, neglectful boyfriends and girlfriends, and overall stupidity from these apes I have grown to despise: Humans. In fact, despised is too strong of a word. I remember when I finished seeing Avengers: Infinity War I was cheering for Thanos and felt sad at the end of the film; not because Thanos wiped out half the population, but that he didn't finish the job. 

Some may find humor in that statement, but I have gotten so far to the point of disgust that being around most others makes me feel nauseated and literally sick. I really want to end it all and I am certain that there is going to be little in the future that gets better.

And I hate the fact that society forces us to stay in a building that we wish to not be in. My body, my choice? yeah right! how come that does not apply to someone who wants to leave the world? Is not my life a part of my body? So, since it is my life, should I not be allowed to end it?

I feel like there is a guillotine with a frayed rope positioned over my neck and I have until July 12 to avoid my own death. 

By July 12 I need to have:
1. Collected $600 to pay the attorney who is representing me at my divorce decree modification hearing. 

2. Completed a parenting class as required by the state of Texas. 

3. A place to do the mediation and the hearing to keep up the guise that I am not habituating in my vehicle. 

I can’t move on from this. I have to sit and listen to some judge decide my life, while in the same “room” as people who have a strong desire to destroy me. 

But I also am not going to be able to do any of those things. I’m not going to be able to make the $600, complete that parenting class or find somewhere to keep up that guise. 

What happens when I don’t? I don’t really know. My lawyer refuses to represent me first probably. I lose my son, which is going to happen anyway because I use cannabis, and cannabis + Texas= bad outcome. I’m found to be in contempt of court and face jail time. 

Why wouldn’t I if the stakes are so high? Because I can’t. I can’t make myself anymore. I can’t make myself work. I can’t make myself pay attention. I can’t make myself be productive anymore. It’s mentally and physically impossible. Between my suspected ASD and diagnosed depression, anxiety, and ADHD, I just can’t.

Sometimes I think even a fresh start somewhere new wouldn’t even work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I want is someone to sit with, laugh, and hug. And not some virtual bs actual physical human contact&lt;/p&gt;

* I failed high school
* Got bullied enough I changed schools
* Push by my mother to drop out, emotionally abused for wanting to change schools
* Counsellors regularly stepped
* Went on a high school exchange overseas and got grounded by my host family
* Wanted to kill myself. My family didn't believe me, cut off medication, had a counsellor step in.
* The counsellor asked my dad to come to support me at my education institution for the day because I was planning on killing myself. He didn't believe me, came, told a family friend why he was there and left early after a few hours.
* Failed a university preparation course
* Kicked out of a university club 4 times
* At one point a lecture was cancelled so I can be taken to the hospital
* Was made to start 2 degrees I didn't want to do by my family
* Emotionally abused by my family
* Cheated my way through the first year of a Computer Science degree and focused way more on a public speaking conference I organised
* Dropped out
* Spiralled into a depression on welfare
* Cut off my family
* Picked up a grocery store job
* Sucked at it (disorganised, kept talking to myself, depressed, kept breaking stuff)
* Started working towards degree again. Haven't even been motivated to try because I cheated my way through the first year.

I feel like a fuck-up. A failure. A loser. Behind in life. Whatever.

Seeing a psychiatrist. My case was complex so the private psychiatrist was unsure what to do and said I need regular treatment with someone I can see in person. This one was online.

They sent a stimulant my way for ADHD which I'm getting on Wednesday but every psychiatrist I've seen is just very confused.

I think I have Aspergers, ADHD, and Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. I relate to them anyway. The private psychiatrist didn't diagnose me but said ADHD is likely.

I hope this stimulant is actually helpful in some way. I'm 25. Pretty much a NEET. Living at home. Failed at high school, university, and employment.

I'm pretty close to committing suicide. I feel so defeated and behind in life, it isn't even worth bothering.

Always considered myself a feminist and grew up hearing awful stories from friends who were SA survivors. I thought being good to others was the only thing that truly mattered. But on our third date, after we had been having phone sex and experimenting with BDSM, when things got heated I went too far, and touched her a few seconds more after she said we should cool down.

Right before graduation, when I started dating my current girlfriend, she filed a complaint and the police opened an investigation. I was suspended. My parents are inconsolable.

I live in eastern Europe, to a country that is considered developed but it's not.

Mental health it's still a taboo, psychiatrists and psychologists are not well trained and very expensive, most of them just give you a bunch of pills there is no one to know erp for ocd, dbt for bpd etc. We have extremely economical issues, you can't find job anywhere, not even to a fast food and school s are crap the same goes with universities also. People here are extremely religious and superstitious and they can't understand how detrimental is that for someone with ocd.

I destroyed myself for a useless degree because education system is so complex and stupid and because I never found proper therapy, I had only unhelpful medication. I feel doomed being here and trapped because I can't find anyone to understand me.

I'm not delusional I don't think that my problems would dissappear if I lived somewhere else but I know for sure that situation here makes everything worse, makes me feel more isolated and anxious. I feel better when I spent time on reddit because I can find people who have the same thoughts but then they suggest me something that I can't apply here or a great advice that I can't follow because I live here.

I have tried many times to explain in too many subs my problems but people seem to not understand my situation and it's logical, they can't even imagine how awful things are here. They take some things for granted when they are not here unfortunately.

My fears with social anxiety and ocd may seem objectivly irrational to most but they are completely rational considering my life. I live in a small town and everyone knows everyone, most people who have mental health problems they hide it to the point to be extremely careful to even visit their doctor. You must always have a good reputation in order to be a part of the society, if your neighbors hear you crying or screaming, you have been destroyed whole town will consider you mentally retired.

I tried many times to share my thoughts in a local mental health forum but most people were so damaged to offer me a meaningful advice or they just told me to take medicines like this is the golden solution fir everything. Some of them they became extremely religious and they can't see any other solution. I don't judge them, it seems the only way to cope here with our situation.

I can also go on and on about how corrupted our whole system are and how people use fake excuses to take allowances and other gifts etc but there is no point. Nobody can understand how its to be here except for someone who lives in one of those countries or in a Balkan country.

I can't live like this anymore and I know there is no point to try to get better because my life will be crap either way. I used to believe that my problem is just mine, I have a different way of thinking not very similar to my culture and the way of living here but I realize that you must be delusional to feel good here.

I'm sure that other people here feel the same way but they just try to ignore it or they just have faith in God.

I don't want to die really but I think I have to. Not because of my country, I have many other reasons but there is no solution here. The only good thing is that when I will fall from the balcony, I won't be saved because hospitals here are so inefficient. I knew someone in my age who fell from much lower high and he still ended up dead when I have read for people who jumbed from much higher place and they lived probably because medical stuff reacted quickly.

I wished someone here would understand but probably I will be ignored again.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t believe that many of you here will understand me since you feel that USA is the worst place to live in but you can&amp;#39;t realize how lucky you may are. I live in eastern Europe, to a country that is considered developed but it&amp;#39;s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mental health it&amp;#39;s still a taboo, psychiatrists and psychologists are not well trained and very expensive, most of them just give you a bunch of pills there is no one to know erp for ocd, dbt for bpd etc. We have extremely economical issues, you can&amp;#39;t find job anywhere, not even to a fast food and school s are crap the same goes with universities also. People here are extremely religious and superstitious and they can&amp;#39;t understand how detrimental is that for someone with ocd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I destroyed myself for a useless degree because education system is so complex and stupid and because I never found proper therapy, I had only unhelpful medication. I feel doomed being here and trapped because I can&amp;#39;t find anyone to understand me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not delusional I don&amp;#39;t think that my problems would dissappear if I lived somewhere else but I know for sure that situation here makes everything worse, makes me feel more isolated and anxious. I feel better when I spent time on reddit because I can find people who have the same thoughts but then they suggest me something that I can&amp;#39;t apply here or a great advice that I can&amp;#39;t follow because I live here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried many times to explain in too many subs my problems but people seem to not understand my situation and it&amp;#39;s logical, they can&amp;#39;t even imagine how awful things are here. They take some things for granted when they are not here unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fears with social anxiety and ocd may seem objectivly irrational to most but they are completely rational considering my life. I live in a small town and everyone knows everyone, most people who have mental health problems they hide it to the point to be extremely careful to even visit their doctor. You must always have a good reputation in order to be a part of the society, if your neighbors hear you crying or screaming, you have been destroyed whole town will consider you mentally retired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried many times to share my thoughts in a local mental health forum but most people were so damaged to offer me a meaningful advice or they just told me to take medicines like this is the golden solution fir everything. Some of them they became extremely religious and they can&amp;#39;t see any other solution. I don&amp;#39;t judge them, it seems the only way to cope here with our situation.&lt;/p&gt;

Literally, it varies on how the day is going that my depression will either spike into suicidal thoughts or if it'll mean that I'll just hate myself.
I was diagnosed with depressive mood disorder in the hospital along with some other things and it doesn't help that my life is pretty shit compared to my friends, even though we are all going through our own problems. I can never see the positive side of life, I feel that I'm wasting time and my family's time and money. I can barely pass my college classes, I'm getting interrogated about my financial spending even though I was taught to budget. I feel that my parent doesn't like me that much anymore, especially after a situation that we went through in 2020, because they had a really bad seizure that cause a psychological break. Which was just great. Ever since that event, I feel like our relationship has just gotten worse and worse. And I feel like giving up honestly. I hate talking to people about my problems because I tell them the same thing everytime, ""You can't help me, so why help me?"" 
The whole time I've been with my parent it's been up and down. Some days they're loving, but most days they come off like they hate me or are disappointed in something that I've done. Although I've tried to do everything right. Nothing is apparently working. And when they talked to their spouse, it's almost like they love them more than me. And I don't understand what I'm doing wrong. Don't get me wrong, I love my parent to death and will do anything for them, but it's really making sad and I'm trying my best to hide my emotions and I'm starting to develop apathy towards the entire situation. 
And that's where the depression and suicidal thoughts linger. My depression is passive, but when something bad happens that can be fixed or if there's an altercation, my depression just plummets and I start feeling suicidal. I try not to come suicidal because then I would have to talk to my parents about it and it's no point because they'll tell me that there's nothing to be sad, angry, or depressed about. Which makes me feel worse and then I just give up and say that there's nothing wrong and try to walk away from the situation. 
Ever since 2020, I feel like I can’t talk to my parent the same way like we used to and on top of that, I'm struggling in college and they're threatening to take me to a military recruiter even though I can't join because psychological reasons. And all of this is causing me really bad depression and causing me to feel suicidal almost everyday, but it's passive like I said. So I don't know what to do.

I just want help and someone to tell me what I'm doing wrong.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hate the fact that I have depression and suicidal ideation. Literally, it varies on how the day is going that my depression will either spike into suicidal thoughts or if it&amp;#39;ll mean that I&amp;#39;ll just hate myself.
I was diagnosed with depressive mood disorder in the hospital along with some other things and it doesn&amp;#39;t help that my life is pretty shit compared to my friends, even though we are all going through our own problems. I can never see the positive side of life, I feel that I&amp;#39;m wasting time and my family&amp;#39;s time and money. I can barely pass my college classes, I&amp;#39;m getting interrogated about my financial spending even though I was taught to budget. I feel that my parent doesn&amp;#39;t like me that much anymore, especially after a situation that we went through in 2020, because they had a really bad seizure that cause a psychological break. Which was just great. Ever since that event, I feel like our relationship has just gotten worse and worse. And I feel like giving up honestly. I hate talking to people about my problems because I tell them the same thing everytime, &amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t help me, so why help me?&amp;quot; 
The whole time I&amp;#39;ve been with my parent it&amp;#39;s been up and down. Some days they&amp;#39;re loving, but most days they come off like they hate me or are disappointed in something that I&amp;#39;ve done. Although I&amp;#39;ve tried to do everything right. Nothing is apparently working. And when they talked to their spouse, it&amp;#39;s almost like they love them more than me. And I don&amp;#39;t understand what I&amp;#39;m doing wrong.

I'm 30 now, I used to work 14-16 hours a day either on my job, or trying to start a business, in 2017 the business was going well and I decided to take a break after working for so long, initially it was supposed to be a month, it turned into 6, it turned into 3 years. Now that I have do much free time I started to think about my past and why do I feel down most of the time, but I couldn't remember a lot of stuff and was started to get depressed and reached out to therapist, within a few sessions she asked me about my childhood and few sessions in I realized I had been sexually abused by family members and sexually assaulted by someone at school, both memories I had completely blocked from my memory, shortly after that the therapist suggested that I need to step away from family and my abuser and people who took advantage of my new situation of having comfortable financial situation.

I wasn't ready yet, I was scared I wouldn't be loved or accepted by anyone else, so I stayed, and my feelings are getting worse everyday, I started to have sex (before I was waiting for marriage, and having sex makes me feel guilty), started to pay for sex, even got paid to fuck a gay guy, I am getting fat, I got more depressed, started to have intrusive thoughts, thinking about hurting myself, thinking about taking drugs, or self harm, suicide.

The love of my life married someone else because family didn't approve on marrying her, and she blocked me and got engaged/married to someone else, started to have feelings towards a hooker that later broke up with me and got engaged to someone else as well. Couple of years after that I saw my first love by chance, she saw me and looked away, so I walked away crying, few days later she called me, said she is not happy, we meet few times then had sex (we never did before), I feel horrible for making her cheat on her husband, never thought I would sleep with a married woman so I feel super guilty about that as well, but we still talk every few days, and I am still trying to fuck her but she keeps rejecting me, yet are is sad whenever I tell her that I might go on a date with someone.

I am scared of getting married, I will either cheat because I am addicted to sex, or she will cheat on my like my gfs before her, or that my child will be abused like I was, or that I won't be a good father like my dad.

I am afraid to go back to work because maybe I am not as good as I was, I don't want to take new risks or get out my comfort zone.

I tried to get a residence in a different country and leave family and memories behind, made as much research as possible but I always back down and find excuses of why that is the right thing to do.

I'm just tired, tired of the self harm, suicidal, intrusive thoughts, tired of being scared to move out, tired from staying home all day everyday, tired of people trying to take advantage of me, tired of lack of trying, tired of how bad and fast I have changed, tired of it all.

Now, even my business, the one thing I was proud of, the what feels like my only achievement is falling apart, and I am unable to do anything to try to fix it. 


Sorry to burden you by all of this, but no one in real life will understand.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not sure about the rules but &lt;strong&gt;trigger warning&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 30 now, I used to work 14-16 hours a day either on my job, or trying to start a business, in 2017 the business was going well and I decided to take a break after working for so long, initially it was supposed to be a month, it turned into 6, it turned into 3 years. Now that I have do much free time I started to think about my past and why do I feel down most of the time, but I couldn&amp;#39;t remember a lot of stuff and was started to get depressed and reached out to therapist, within a few sessions she asked me about my childhood and few sessions in I realized I had been sexually abused by family members and sexually assaulted by someone at school, both memories I had completely blocked from my memory, shortly after that the therapist suggested that I need to step away from family and my abuser and people who took advantage of my new situation of having comfortable financial situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t ready yet, I was scared I wouldn&amp;#39;t be loved or accepted by anyone else, so I stayed, and my feelings are getting worse everyday, I started to have sex (before I was waiting for marriage, and having sex makes me feel guilty), started to pay for sex, even got paid to fuck a gay guy, I am getting fat, I got more depressed, started to have intrusive thoughts, thinking about hurting myself, thinking about taking drugs, or self harm, suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The love of my life married someone else because family didn&amp;#39;t approve on marrying her, and she blocked me and got engaged/married to someone else, started to have feelings towards a hooker that later broke up with me and got engaged to someone else as well. Couple of years after that I saw my first love by chance, she saw me and looked away, so I walked away crying, few days later she called me, said she is not happy, we meet few times then had sex (we never did before), I feel horrible for making her cheat on her husband, never thought I would sleep with a married woman so I feel super guilty about that as well, but we still talk every few days, and I am still trying to fuck her but she keeps rejecting me, yet are is sad whenever I tell her that I might go on a date with someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am scared of getting married, I will either cheat because I am addicted to sex, or she will cheat on my like my gfs before her, or that my child will be abused like I was, or that I won&amp;#39;t be a good father like my dad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am afraid to go back to work because maybe I am not as good as I was, I don&amp;#39;t want to take new risks or get out my comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to get a residence in a different country and leave family and memories behind, made as much research as possible but I always back down and find excuses of why that is the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just tired, tired of the self harm, suicidal, intrusive thoughts, tired of being scared to move out, tired from staying home all day everyday, tired of people trying to take advantage of me, tired of lack of trying, tired of how bad and fast I have changed, tired of it all.&lt;/p&gt;

My parents have told me NUMEROUS TIMES, that I would be unable to move out and live on my own if I don’t have a driver license and a car.

I would talk about how I was SO RELIEVED that self driving cars were being developed and tested. I still do support them (and they’re still probably 5-10+ years away from consumer access, let alone going mainstream) even when I feel I might manage to pass my driving test and drive on my own everyday.

I didn’t even properly conquer my fear of driving. I just decided that with how limiting not driving is, my life isn’t worth being so protective over, so the benefits of driving outweigh the risks of dying in a car accident. Surviving, but in a vegetative state of paralysis, WOULD NOT be worth it, but still seems not worth worrying about to the point of refusing to drive.

While I simply stopped caring about the fatal dangers of driving, I did improve A LOT. Written portion of the test was easier than ANY school test I’ve EVER taken.

But, it seems even after the bizarre urges to do dangerous things such as floor and brake, jerk the wheel, have long since disappeared, it seems I STILL LACK CONTROL, EVEN WITHOUT IMPULSES, EVEN WITH GENUINELY TRYING MY BEST, it seems I STILL can’t control myself/the car very well.

I can’t stay completely in the lane, I drift to close to the curb because I’m trying to ensure I’m not close enough to the opposite lane, so I avoid any head on collisions, and parallel parking makes no sense direction wise (this is actually WELL KNOWN to cause new drivers to fail the test, but most still get it at least after a few attempts).

I lose sense of direction having to control the vehicle while going backwards, because left and right now mean right and left and keep switching.

My mom is too terrified to be in the car with me, my dad is an abusive closed minded jackass, and my stepdad who drives big trucks for a living can be a jackass too but even he said I made him “scared” when I was driving.

And because I “almost drove into the garage wall”, behind my back he said “well his sister may not even be old enough to drive she’s actually NORMAL”.

This mofo has tried to force me to drive, even threatening to charge me more rent if I just use Uber, and now “he’s scared” of me driving.

Why not just continue taking Uber and trying to get a better job that doesn’t require driving as part of the job? Well, without a proper past high school education, any decent paying real job requires driving as part of the job, like the trades. Constantly taking Uber won’t cut it. Real estate agent? “Nobody wants to buy from an agent who’s going house to house in an Uber”. Also that does require heavy social skills…… makes me shudder.

I’m stuck as a goddamn grocery bagger/cart pusher. I do a lot of physical labor, often 40 hours a week, and don’t make even $1,600 a month. I have to follow these STUPID scripts BY THE LETTER or get a nasty look and written up.

I feel less than human, just some emotionless, no personality robotic shell zombie.

I’m losing my parents health insurance by the end of this year, the SSRI withdrawal is going to be a fate worse than death. Life isn’t worth fighting for, I don’t give a fucking shit about competing.

Even if I was somehow able to work from home, live in a big city with mass transit/walkability, and the PERFECT FOR ME WOMAN appeared, I don’t think I’m capable of being in a relationship, I have too much baggage and damage, I don’t think I have the capacity or emotional availability at this point. If the SSRI withdrawal gives me permanent sexual dysfunction and complete emotional numbness, I’ll be better off. But I’m BEST OFF DEAD, either way.

I’m 25 and still nowhere near being able to function on my own, I shouldn’t even be ENTERTAINING THE IDEA of having a girlfriend. I need a lobotomy and castration. But again, best off dead, either way.

I hate this BS society, I’ve never fit into it, I may have less bizarre impulses as I grew older, but I still have absolutely no social or life understanding.

My mom, who has panic attacks and refuse to be in the car with me driving, now lets my 15 YEAR OLD SISTER, who’s she CONSTANTLY MAD AT for doing drugs, sneaking out, and hiding guys in the house.

Step dad who’s “the master at driving” and it’s his LITERAL LIVELIHOOD, is even scared of my driving. Last time he yelled and it triggered my anger and PTSD, I can’t deal with this shit called “being an adult”.

I don’t understand how it comes naturally to most people, even to those younger than me, which proves, that it’s obviously not strictly an age thing. 

I want to swallow my entire 12,000+ MG of Sertraline and hopefully die from the serotonin syndrome, but my prescription is closer to empty and the fucking pharmacy closed and won’t be open tomorrow either.

I wanted to go before I was supposed to work at that place again tomorrow. Let the assholes get pissed off that I quit showing up because they like to schedule me to clear an entire parking lot all by myself for 8 hours straight.

Fuck this society, can even be denied pills because “can’t afford them without insurance” and the fucking police and asshole staff in mental hospitals can physically force you to stay alive, AND THEN give you a bill that can put you in lifelong debt.

Maybe I can get the police to shoot me, but I’m afraid it won’t even kill me. Police work 24/7, I wouldn’t have to wait until “pharmacy hours” reopen 2 days from now. But I’m doubtful they’ll shoot me fatally, and then force me into a mental hospital if not prison where I’ll get m fucking ass raped and locked in solitary probably through forced med withdrawal.

What options do I have at this point? I’m too selfish and impatient to be a wageslave for 40+ years while waiting for investments to grow and “unlock that 401K/Roth IRA”, I don’t care about that shit, the thought of living that much longer is unbearable and what’s the point if I have to waste my entire life away to POSSIBLY “enjoy life” in the last few years of my life?

Nobody gets it because they’re living a life worth living even during their youth, so they can’t relate to the mindset.

Going to lose my virginity to an escort before killing myself doesn’t even seem worth it. If I’m about to be dead, why bother doing anything before I die? Besides, I could arrested in a “sting” operation because even if it’s “consensual adults” sex is a crime if you pay for it. Unless I go to Nevada, but like I said, when I die I’ll be dead and nothing will matter anymore anyway.

After my mom said that I completely lost my appetite, and even LITERAL SHIT never stops me from eating. But this? This might be it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do not have my driver license, been to afraid for years, and it has been very restrictive and limiting on my life. My parents have told me NUMEROUS TIMES, that I would be unable to move out and live on my own if I don’t have a driver license and a car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would talk about how I was SO RELIEVED that self driving cars were being developed and tested. I still do support them (and they’re still probably 5-10+ years away from consumer access, let alone going mainstream) even when I feel I might manage to pass my driving test and drive on my own everyday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t even properly conquer my fear of driving. I just decided that with how limiting not driving is, my life isn’t worth being so protective over, so the benefits of driving outweigh the risks of dying in a car accident. Surviving, but in a vegetative state of paralysis, WOULD NOT be worth it, but still seems not worth worrying about to the point of refusing to drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I simply stopped caring about the fatal dangers of driving, I did improve A LOT. Written portion of the test was easier than ANY school test I’ve EVER taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, it seems even after the bizarre urges to do dangerous things such as floor and brake, jerk the wheel, have long since disappeared, it seems I STILL LACK CONTROL, EVEN WITHOUT IMPULSES, EVEN WITH GENUINELY TRYING MY BEST, it seems I STILL can’t control myself/the car very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t stay completely in the lane, I drift to close to the curb because I’m trying to ensure I’m not close enough to the opposite lane, so I avoid any head on collisions, and parallel parking makes no sense direction wise (this is actually WELL KNOWN to cause new drivers to fail the test, but most still get it at least after a few attempts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lose sense of direction having to control the vehicle while going backwards, because left and right now mean right and left and keep switching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom is too terrified to be in the car with me, my dad is an abusive closed minded jackass, and my stepdad who drives big trucks for a living can be a jackass too but even he said I made him “scared” when I was driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because I “almost drove into the garage wall”, behind my back he said “well his sister may not even be old enough to drive she’s actually NORMAL”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mofo has tried to force me to drive, even threatening to charge me more rent if I just use Uber, and now “he’s scared” of me driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not just continue taking Uber and trying to get a better job that doesn’t require driving as part of the job? Well, without a proper past high school education, any decent paying real job requires driving as part of the job, like the trades. Constantly taking Uber won’t cut it. Real estate agent? “Nobody wants to buy from an agent who’s going house to house in an Uber”. Also that does require heavy social skills…… makes me shudder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m stuck as a goddamn grocery bagger/cart pusher. I do a lot of physical labor, often 40 hours a week, and don’t make even $1,600 a month. I have to follow these STUPID scripts BY THE LETTER or get a nasty look and written up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel less than human, just some emotionless, no personality robotic shell zombie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m losing my parents health insurance by the end of this year, the SSRI withdrawal is going to be a fate worse than death. Life isn’t worth fighting for, I don’t give a fucking shit about competing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if I was somehow able to work from home, live in a big city with mass transit/walkability, and the PERFECT FOR ME WOMAN appeared, I don’t think I’m capable of being in a relationship, I have too much baggage and damage, I don’t think I have the capacity or emotional availability at this point. If the SSRI withdrawal gives me permanent sexual dysfunction and complete emotional numbness, I’ll be better off. But I’m BEST OFF DEAD, either way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m 25 and still nowhere near being able to function on my own, I shouldn’t even be ENTERTAINING THE IDEA of having a girlfriend. I need a lobotomy and castration. But again, best off dead, either way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate this BS society, I’ve never fit into it, I may have less bizarre impulses as I grew older, but I still have absolutely no social or life understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom, who has panic attacks and refuse to be in the car with me driving, now lets my 15 YEAR OLD SISTER, who’s she CONSTANTLY MAD AT for doing drugs, sneaking out, and hiding guys in the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step dad who’s “the master at driving” and it’s his LITERAL LIVELIHOOD, is even scared of my driving. Last time he yelled and it triggered my anger and PTSD, I can’t deal with this shit called “being an adult”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t understand how it comes naturally to most people, even to those younger than me, which proves, that it’s obviously not strictly an age thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to swallow my entire 12,000+ MG of Sertraline and hopefully die from the serotonin syndrome, but my prescription is closer to empty and the fucking pharmacy closed and won’t be open tomorrow either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to go before I was supposed to work at that place again tomorrow. Let the assholes get pissed off that I quit showing up because they like to schedule me to clear an entire parking lot all by myself for 8 hours straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck this society, can even be denied pills because “can’t afford them without insurance” and the fucking police and asshole staff in mental hospitals can physically force you to stay alive, AND THEN give you a bill that can put you in lifelong debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I can get the police to shoot me, but I’m afraid it won’t even kill me. Police work 24/7, I wouldn’t have to wait until “pharmacy hours” reopen 2 days from now. But I’m doubtful they’ll shoot me fatally, and then force me into a mental hospital if not prison where I’ll get m fucking ass raped and locked in solitary probably through forced med withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What options do I have at this point? I’m too selfish and impatient to be a wageslave for 40+ years while waiting for investments to grow and “unlock that 401K/Roth IRA”, I don’t care about that shit, the thought of living that much longer is unbearable and what’s the point if I have to waste my entire life away to POSSIBLY “enjoy life” in the last few years of my life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody gets it because they’re living a life worth living even during their youth, so they can’t relate to the mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going to lose my virginity to an escort before killing myself doesn’t even seem worth it. If I’m about to be dead, why bother doing anything before I die? Besides, I could arrested in a “sting” operation because even if it’s “consensual adults” sex is a crime if you pay for it.

I was diagnosed with ADHD so trialled dexamphetamines courtesy of a psych for two months but they ended up triggering a psychotic manic episode of sorts, maybe due to combined daily weed usage as well, but especially when the guy I was casually seeing for 6 months broke things off with me, as well as getting into a stressful situation with my best friend at the time. The episode lasted 6 months though it felt like time flew past me, so much happened during that time: I cut off the aforementioned people, had them call the cops on me because of the state I was in, deleted a bunch of people off my facebook, told people I was a psychic medium, thought I was talking to spirits and living people through a psychic link, crashed my car at 90kmh yet was miraculously unharmed, had my mother say I was possessed by demons and sprayed me in the face with a shower head, was flown to a mental health facility 4 hours away and spent a week there, lost my pet rat to illness and was so mentally ill myself that I wasn't taking care of her or spending time with her in her last months, had my mother and others raid my room - breaking things, reading private journals and throwing away stuff in the process, spent a month (including my birthday) at a friend's parent's house - haven't hung out with the friend in years since his girlfriend doesn't like that we slept together years ago, spent all my savings on overpriced crystal jewelry and dumb crap, got stuck thinking about all my past mistakes and people that I've lost over the years because of my own selfish recklessness and ""I could die any day"" attitude, told my very loving father to ""fuck off"" for the first (and only) time in my life, also had father tell me not to call him ""daddy"" and say ""who are you trying to con now?"" about something I said/did, had mother say ""you want to live, you're the sperm that won"" plus coming at me for a personality disorder I haven't been diagnosed with and calling me toxic to the family, had my little sister call the cops on me for my erratic behaviour, have been kicked out of the family home and currently living with my nana, although that might change soon and I don't know if I want it to. 

I have so much anger towards my mother and how she's treated me my whole life, since she has anger issues and would always yell and scream about the smallest things, stomping around the house yelling about how I'm a ""useless, lazy cunt"" and other things over the years. She also smokes weed and I used to be so avidly against it since I realised as a young child and was scared that my sister and I would be taken away from her/lose her to getting arrested but when I found out my first boyfriend was a smoker when I was 17 I begrudgingly joined the bandwagon with him and his friends back in 2014-2015. This caused problems in our relationship, plus other things, and I ended up cheating on him with his best friend in a whole mess that dragged on until 2016, when he broke up with me and his best friend ended up ghosting me... I went off rails, ended up smoking more and more, trialled mood stabilisers and got drunk at a party then ended up sleeping with a friends boyfriend so was kicked out of that friendship group. Ex-boyfriend and that friend ended up dating which was a huge stab to the heart, but I never blamed either of them for not wanting me in their lives after everything I did wrong, although my ex stayed close with his best friend and my ex-friend stayed with her boyfriend for a year after he cheated while I was no longer welcome in the group. This made me feel like extra trash in comparison since they kept the other offending people in their lives while I was kicked to the curb; thankfully I had my best friend and her boyfriend, still, even dated the both of them in 2017 but that failed and I was kicked out of their house for continuing to smoke weed, day in and day out. These are the same two people that I lost during my psychotic episode that started at the end of last year and only ended a couple months ago, since then I've felt like my brain is broken like my thoughts do not form the same and I am no longer the actually fun person I was before. I haven't smoked for a couple months, either, though I kept smoking through the episode because it was already too late and I'd fucked everything up and lost all that I held dear. I spend every day now sleeping for as long as possible, until about 2-4pm, then drag myself to work until 11pm and just watch TV like a vegetable while I try not to cry... which fails since I cry every damn day since regaining sanity. I've read that some people never recover, mentally, from such an episode as it causes actual brain damage which has left me feeling devastated because I just want to go back to the way things used to be, as I would see my best friend 2-3 times a week and also the guy I had been crushing on for 3 years, her now ex-boyfriend, but obviously none of that will ever be the same... I was so happy that he finally asked to see me, even casually, after years of hoping for another chance after the failed polyamory attempt of 2017 but now he's living with some other chick who's his new best friend, while my best friend has moved into a new house with her other boyfriend, so even that dynamic has changed after 7-8 years of knowing them, and them being together. I'm grateful they've both been talking to me a little bit but it's a drastic change from seeing them every week since I was 16, even having lived with them twice before... not to mention my brain flinging me back to 2014-2015, the only time I had a serious relationship and wishing I could go back that far in time, not just back to before this mental breakdown destroyed my friendship, family and actual brain. 

It's extremely difficult to see a bright future ahead when each year things have gotten worse for me, especially with physical brain damage in the mix. I may be able to recover but the opposite is also true so I'm finding it extremely hard to want to be alive... I've told my father that I don't want to live and him saying that, if I died, he would too if making me feel forced to live... I don't want to destroy my family but my existence is honestly barely worth living and it's practically impossible to recover from the emotional and mental abuse my mother has dealt me, especially since she doesn't see her issues as anything that would have majorly impacted me, even though any personality disorder I may have could greatly be linked to the way she's treated me. 

I just want to reconcile those negative feelings towards my mother, since she tries to be loving, but she's also very controlling and won't even let me eat in my bedroom anymore or let the dogs inside, so if I do move back in it will honestly feel worse than before. Not to mention the majority of my property is now stored at my uncles in tubs that she organised so I don't even know where any of my stuff is which leaves me feeling angry and annoyed and upset constantly with her. Plus again the aforementioned invasion of my private journals and property including kink items that I'm not at all comfortable with her or my father having seen. It's hard to not feel responsible though since that invasion of privacy wouldn't have happened if I hadn't suffered a mental breakdown, same with the sudden rules of not eating in bedrooms or having the dogs inside, which affects my sister negatively as well. 

I'm thinking that if I save up $10 000 then send half to mum, half to dad, then leave my property for my sister I can just kill myself and be done with it even though I know they'd much rather have me alive, I'm sick to death of crying all the time and thinking about how great life used to be and how fucked in the head I am because of genetics/upbringing/past experiences, not to mention the loneliness of having lost my best friends. The loss of brain function after having a meltdown is, of course, the worst of it, plus being unable to ever touch weed again, as it had grown on me over the years, although it was definitely an addiction I should have fixed long ago. Just something I used to numb the pain of fucking up back in 2016, plus my best friends also smoked so was easy to do socially, even though I lost social contact with people who didn't smoke since I was constantly high and couldn't go more than a couple hours without smoking... didn't have my much of a job back then, would even smoke before work and on break, now it's gone forever. Which is probably for the best anyway but to lose the option entirely, not to mention the only way to actually treat ADHD, which I still have, and I'm feeling awfully unrepeatable for the mental shit I was already dealing with.

If you've made it through this wall of text, just know that I appreciate the time you've spent. I looked up this sub and, at the same time, received a text from one of my mum's friend's who is a psychic medium (hence where that delusion came from, I know another lady who is another friend of my mums and a medium I have seen for years with amazingly accurate advice, I'm normally more practical/sceptical but have had enough proof to believe in such things) which is always interesting... maybe I just wanted to feel special, I definitely didn't want to feel so lonely anymore, that's for sure, and if spirits actually wanted to talk to me I was overjoyed. But the lack of brain functioning really emphasises that I had a mental breakdown, even with physical evidence to tell me otherwise on some fronts, it was really hard to rip myself away from some delusions when they had some merit to them... I just wish it hadn't happened, as I was barely clinging to my will to live and dearly miss what I used to have with my friends in my life. And wish I didn't go through the extra trauma my mother provided, she didn't handle the situation well and neither did my father, really, but nobody really had experience with psychosis and I really wasn't helping myself at the time, either.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve gone through too much and done too much to really ever recover but this really tipped the scales into a realm of pure darkness.

I work a robotic job for 16/hr try to just do my part to survive going no where, come home to find out one of my roommates lost $20. 
Oh well surely they will realize they lost it when they were out the night before drinking right? Nope I get yelled and called a thief every day since last week… cool. 
Today is my birthday, and I had plans to hangout with friends to get me out of this slump. 
Nope my other roommate decided to move out out of no where texting me “figure it out” now I can’t pay their side of the rent this month, not to mention they are currently trying to convince my other roommate to leave with them so I just get fucked. 
so now on my birthday I need to figure out how I’m going to come up with an $600/1200… awesome. 
And just the icing on the cake I get called up by my mother on my birthday and before she wished me a happy day she asks what I’m doing with my life.

I’m quite aware this isn’t the worst situation anyone has dealt with believe me but all this happening within the last week being ganged up and and called things I’ve never been just sucks. Especially since I already deal with anxiety and depression. 

Life just finds a way to fuck certain people. The only thing I can think of to stop myself from being evicted is betting my cash on black I literally have no other clue what to do.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Definitely at a point in my life that will change everything. I’m really done with everything and if I had some balls it would be over right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I literally just try to do my part and stay in my lane, but somehow problems always love to find their way over to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work a robotic job for 16/hr try to just do my part to survive going no where, come home to find out one of my roommates lost $20. 
Oh well surely they will realize they lost it when they were out the night before drinking right? Nope I get yelled and called a thief every day since last week… cool. 
Today is my birthday, and I had plans to hangout with friends to get me out of this slump. 
Nope my other roommate decided to move out out of no where texting me “figure it out” now I can’t pay their side of the rent this month, not to mention they are currently trying to convince my other roommate to leave with them so I just get fucked.

I suffer with a fairly common, yet not really talked about OCD subset that focuses on extreme distress and fear of becoming a Pedophile despite probably being the furthest thing from one. 

It’s just so incredibly difficult to even live with myself somedays. And honestly sometimes the horrible thought spirals can eat up multiple days. 

I just feels so incredibly real even though I know logically that it’s not. Which in a way is worse because I’m kinda going crazy split between my reasoning side and my emotional side. 

I had the thought that maybe suicide would be a way of taking responsibility if it turned out to actually be a pedo. 
That way I could never hurt anyone.

I met this girl, we'll call her Marcy, in 2019 through a friend. I was pretty down on myself at the time, and he gave me Marcy's snapchat because he thought we would be a good fit. He was so painfully right.

We called each other for most of the following days after we met, and the calls would go to absurd lengths. We ended up just leaving them on when we slept so we could talk while we were going to bed, I think our record call length was around 27 hours.

So, you get the picture. We instantly connected and it was seriously one of the weirdest feelings I had ever experienced. It felt like someone was finally looking at my soul instead of me just as a person. We dated for around 4 months, and then she broke up with me. We were both 16-17 at the time, so it definitely felt like a teenage relationship with a weird amount of connection.

Fast foward to 2020, we end up dating again for around 6 months before things start to get a little rough. We both opened up about some insanely personal mental health issues, with mine mainly consisting of a ton of suicidal thoughts. We sort of just... imploded. Things were really uncomfortable for about a week, and I very irrationally broke up with her. It was a very spur of the moment decision, looking back. We constantly talked about ideas for cool weddings, what we would do when we were super old, it was genuinely some of the most personal love I have ever felt.

Fast forward another 6 months after I broke up with her. I'm still basically in the same spot I was right after we broke up. I wake up exhausted, but it feels almost impossible to sleep without her there, given that we were essentially the same person. On top of really bad insomnia, I sleep about once every other day.

 We spent the better part of those 6 months of dating together, and I mean that very literally. We had multiple month stretches where we slept in the same bed, woke up and went about the day, then went back home together. My friend that introduced me to her has always said that he is the world's best friend for introducing us, but now that things are the way they are, all he wants me to do is move on.

I honestly believe it's impossible without a whole lot of time passing. I cannot find a single reason that justifies living, especially when put into comparison with how sad I still am about it. My future is pretty dim, I definitely don't have enough money for college but I'm moving in a month to go to college anyway. I don't even really feel fear about any of this anymore, as it feels like nothing i do will distract me from the fact that I nuked most of my life with this. Marcy was the only one who made it feel like someone understood what I felt on a daily basis, but I couldn't think of that *one* time before making the decision to end things.

what do you do though when someone really does want you dead? it's scary and isolating and makes death feel inevitable and like the actual only escape. and it's like, i don't want him to get what he wants but i still don't want to live either. i don't know how to live with someone i loved pushing me this far, i don't feel human at all.

what do i even do with this? i know he's messed up and i know i have value, but something inside me is gone now or broken and i really just don't see myself being here this time next year, i can't.

i'm so paranoid and afraid now and i feel so pathetic and worthless and confused as to how my life even ended up like this. i don't understand and i don't feel good and every time i think about any of it it's just debilitating. i hate myself so much for ending up here, i feel like i should've been smarter and less trusting and less forgiving even though i wouldn't think that way about someone else being in this position. or like, i knew better. i think. but everyone always has told me i'm too cynical and judgmental and untrusting and isolated and slow to forgive and antisocial and then when i tried to do the right things and give benefit-of-the-doubt and a second chance and forgiveness and openness and everything it fucking destroyed my entire life and self and everything about me

I haven’t had any paid job since April of 2017, parents have been supportive but I can’t continue to be a leech, I keep sending resumes, despite having a master’s degree and two bachelor’s, I still couldn’t find any jobs. 

Today a guy dumped me using my own words against me and keeping looking for excuses, I know I’m just too poor to relocate to Europe and he doesn’t find me sexually attractive in the end. He lied a lot to me and I feel so sad. I said in the beginning the fundamental of us are honest and comprehensive conversations. He didn’t tell me before today that he actually never liked me talking sexually while he actually sends me NSFW picture and talk to me in a sexual way. He just suddenly tells me it’s wrong to do so and have me dumped. I believed him so much and I told him all my sexual kink.

Is that correct if you have no money, nobody wants to be with you? Yeah that’s absolutely correct

Is it wrong to hope for someone in your life to help each other in this cruel world? Yes it is wrong, nobody would ever want that. 

Now imaging I’m turning 27 this year, being jobless and spent $300,000 in these years as oversea student, China doesn’t even want to go back, I don’t have the money to buy tickets to go back…. I will just take meds soon and end my life.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m 26 yo guy without a job in Australia.
I haven’t had any paid job since April of 2017, parents have been supportive but I can’t continue to be a leech, I keep sending resumes, despite having a master’s degree and two bachelor’s, I still couldn’t find any jobs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today a guy dumped me using my own words against me and keeping looking for excuses, I know I’m just too poor to relocate to Europe and he doesn’t find me sexually attractive in the end. He lied a lot to me and I feel so sad. I said in the beginning the fundamental of us are honest and comprehensive conversations. He didn’t tell me before today that he actually never liked me talking sexually while he actually sends me NSFW picture and talk to me in a sexual way. He just suddenly tells me it’s wrong to do so and have me dumped. I believed him so much and I told him all my sexual kink.&lt;/p&gt;

I have social anxiety, depression, ocd, blah blah blah

  I do not feel as if I am a good person. I have a great deal of empathy for others, but that only gets me hurt in the long run. I complain too much about my mental troubles and how they haven’t gone away. My loved ones just eyeroll at this point, I have been hurting plenty of times before therefore I do not get to complain about the pain anymore. 

    I don’t know if I’m being gaslit or not, seeing as that’s kind of the point of gaslighting. I have been trained to believe that I am always in the wrong when it comes to these things. If I’m not in the wrong, then that means I can trust less people than I thought, if I am, then I’m a narcissistic asshole for thinking what I’m thinking. Idk there’s just no favorable outcome. I’m forcing myself to go to a new school, and I’m naturally terrified about that seeing as I’m the artsy eccentric type who’s really into avant-garde music and all that.

    But the main thing that has got me insecure and depressed are my fetishes. Everywhere I go online it seems it’s just people being mocked over their fetishes and kinks. I cannot rationalize my kinks as I know that I am the problem. I did not ask to be into this shit. I usually come on this sub every day on my main acc and search for people who are also dealing with insecurities over their fetishes and see if I can’t offer some sort of comfort to them, but I saw one post by some person who shared my kink and the replies except for those who also possessed it were agreeing with him that he was fucked up. It just really hurts knowing that I will never be accepted anywhere due to something I cannot control, not even in spaces specifically designed for peer support.

Personally, I thought random suicide thoughts were pretty normal. Even somewhat useful as a mental no-man's land, allowing a perspective on life entirely, as opposed to seeing one or two things from the vantage point of single pillar of life. Seeing the wood from the trees, in a way.

Wouldn't call it pleasant, because it can last longer than what's desirable/ practical. But it's refreshing when it's over. Allows me to re-establish priorities, which is understandable when the social environment is somewhat unstable at the moment.

Is this a bad sign and I'm just kidding myself? Or is suicidal depression like love, where you won't know it until you just know it? Or possibly something along a linear axis, possibly a Cartesian plane? X-axis = how good/ bad the feeling is, and y-axis = how near/ far you feel from the feeling.

at school every single kid around bullied me relentlessly and i was known for being the weird kid. every teacher who was at my school except for one lovely black teacher who had my back and regularly lectured me about being a black girl in america, was unashamedly, and publicly racist even though i live in progressive western washington. my 3rd through 5th grade teacher singled me out and traumatized me regularly by yelling at me in front of the class, encouraging other kids to laugh at me and throw things at me, insulting me herself every day, ensuring i didn't get the education i was supposed to, blah fucking blah for 3 years. there's so much worse she did. all i had were video games, professional wrestling and stuffed animals. i had no other consistent hobbies because i was extremely sheltered, even until today, there's nothing i enjoy doing. everything is just to pass the time. i went to wrestlemania 37 in april which was probably the peak of my life.

I was supposed to go back to work after missing it for two weeks from a severe concussion before my hospitalization and the district manager was so mad at me missing those shifts that he said “I hope the reason no one has heard from them is because the were successful” and stopped scheduling me. All of my things had been boxed up and moved to my mom’s house before I even left the hospital and the person I would’ve called my best friend answered their phone with “I only answered because you still have stuff at my house” when I called her. That everyone so easily believed whatever my relatives have said about me hurt a lot, especially being told to go back to my mom after everything I told them about my home life. 

But what hurts the most about this situation is that I was right about my doubts I’ve been having with my friends. With some context, family is an f word to me. Because of prior situations with abandonment before and how my own relatives have treated me I’ve always hated being called family by others and still believe that people say it too easily. This entire situation has only validated that for me and I can’t believe anything people have said before now because the people I trusted the most have left me like this. 

Since leaving the hospital and the loss of everyone I care about, I have tried to kill myself 4 more times to no success at all. I tried to overdose on different medications without any observed effect, starving and dehydrating myself only to cave and eat, and even tried to hang myself again before getting caught and having the belt taken away.

Everyone told me that they can’t help me anymore and that I can only help myself now but after all of this I couldn’t even begin to build the care I would need for myself after being left so easily.

In spite of it all I know that they are all better off without me because I’m not a good person for any of them to be around, some have even told me how much better they feel in the month I’ve been gone from all of them. I hurt them all by trying to kill myself last month and they all don’t need me around anymore.

I just wish that I knew what else they believe I lied to them about because they keep telling me that I have been lying to them about a lot of things but not telling me what about, just that I have been lying. I want to see any one of them and just hear what they think and what they were told but none of them have answered my calls in a week now from what I can only believe to mean they’ve blocked me and by all appearances have removed me on all other media.

I don't think any emotionally painful period of life (like getting fired, loosing someone you love, being in an abusive relationship, etc) will last forever. Everything ends eventually.

But just because you solved one problem, doesn't mean there aren't more lying ahead.

That's what my whole life has been like. I was bullied in elementary and middle school for most of my life, and my parents were abusive. Once I got out of elementary and middle school, I was excited for high school because I wouldn't ever have to see any of the people who ever made fun of me again. But high school wasn't any better. In fact, it was worse. That's when I met my abuser, who was the whole reason for my CPTSD.

Even though all of this shit was happening, the one thing that kept me going was the hope that things would get better. I thought all this pain would end and I would finally get a chance to heal and be happy. 

That never happens though. As soon as one problem ends, another starts.

Not to say that good things didn't happen. My parents and I went to therapy, where they slowly learned how to actually be good parents, and I learned how to cope with everything that's been happening to me.

But like I said, as soon as one problem ends, another starts.

Just when I was just starting to heal, just when my mom and I where just starting to have a normal relationship, my mom died. It made me realize that every time something starts getting better in my life, something terrible happens right after. My whole life has been like this, and it doesn't seem to stop throwing shit at me anytime soon.

At this point, I just give up. I'm tired of having hope, because I know things aren't going to get better for me. I *know* life can be amazing. I *know* there are genuinely good people on this floating rock we call Earth. But good things don't always happen to good people. And I'm not exactly a ""good person"" anyway.

I wish things could've been different. I wish I had a hint of luck, so that, maybe, one good thing would permanent stay with me. But unfortunately, I've been cursed to live this shitty life.

Just wait for me mom. Hopefully, I'll be there soon. &lt;3","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;People tell me, &amp;quot;Oh, it&amp;#39;ll get better! Things will get easier!&amp;quot; and they&amp;#39;re right, to a certain extent.&lt;/p&gt;

I really do good work, and I'm efficient, I just can't do 40 hours a week. I just can't do it. I am so tired and really need extra time to myself to not be suicidal. 

But it doesn't matter if I'm efficient and I do good work. It doesn't matter if I have a degree (actually, that makes things worse hour wise). Nobody wants to hire a part timer. Nobody wants an employee that works less than 40 hours a week, and if they do, the benefits are probably awful and the pay doesn't make up for the lack of hours. 

I think maybe I could handle 40 hours a week if it was in a really meaningful and balanced job. Taking care of animals, people, or nature.

But that doesn't matter to society either.  Those types of jobs are paid shit-tier. We've built an economy that cares only about business, shareholders, and profits. The economy doesn't care about empathy, humanity, animals, or the future of the Earth. 

Society does not value me. In fact, they see me as a pain. If I give up on the 40 hour work week and go on welfare, I'm lazy, I'm a leech. If I allow the 40 hour workweek to push me to suicide, I'm selfish. 

I exist only to line the pockets of the rich. My feelings and welfare are irrelevant.

&lt;p&gt;But it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if I&amp;#39;m efficient and I do good work. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter if I have a degree (actually, that makes things worse hour wise). Nobody wants to hire a part timer. Nobody wants an employee that works less than 40 hours a week, and if they do, the benefits are probably awful and the pay doesn&amp;#39;t make up for the lack of hours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think maybe I could handle 40 hours a week if it was in a really meaningful and balanced job. Taking care of animals, people, or nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that doesn&amp;#39;t matter to society either.  Those types of jobs are paid shit-tier. We&amp;#39;ve built an economy that cares only about business, shareholders, and profits. The economy doesn&amp;#39;t care about empathy, humanity, animals, or the future of the Earth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Society does not value me. In fact, they see me as a pain. If I give up on the 40 hour work week and go on welfare, I&amp;#39;m lazy, I&amp;#39;m a leech. If I allow the 40 hour workweek to push me to suicide, I&amp;#39;m selfish. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I exist only to line the pockets of the rich. My feelings and welfare are irrelevant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not valuable to society and I see no future here. I want to die. I want to die so badly.&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t look forward to anything. I don’t want anything, except to not have to feel anymore.

The only eventful thing that seems to happen in my life is that I constantly get completely crippled by my own mind.

I’ll try to sum up my problem as quick as possible. 

- Just read the Text and I can’t really express myself because I’m not a native English speaker but I hope you get my point.

Since day 1 the odds were basically against me. Growing up without a dad, my mom being so sick to the point that she is not able to work. Having to raise myself for the most part since I’m 12. Living in public/social housing etc. 

First it was a motivation for me. I’m gonna beat the odds bla bla. But now my strength is fading day by day and death starts to sound like a salvation for me. 

I’m devasted because since I have to care for me and my mother I knew I had to get some money. So I did school and landed a decent paid job ngl. But the job is killing me. I leave the house at 7 am - come home at 8pm then I cook and then I go to sleep. That has been my life for the last 3 months. I just want someone to support me. I’m alone since I’m 12 man and I can’t take it anymore. Then I met a girl. We talked everyday for 8 Months. We met a couple times and she knew my intentions with her (I was 110% in love). 
Suddenly she had a boyfriend and my best friend told me he fucked her basically the whole time we were talking. 

Man since that I can’t eat or sleep anymore really and it’s 6 months ago. 

I always thought if I take all that shit and stay grinding it will get better. But it just doesn’t 

So matter in fact I can’t take it anymore. I can’t be alone for another long period while hustling everyday without any support. 

I tend to ask why me?

Two months and a half ago I met and lived my first romance story in my entire life and gave my firsts kisses with her, I felt so unstoppable and happy, i felt like i found the light of grace with her, and I could just not stop of holding hands and hugging her meanwhile she beautifully smiled at me and returned the hugs and took my hand in her waist to hold her, sadly she lives in another city at 82 miles from my city I know doesn’t look that much but the road is like two hours driving and she is no willing to have a long distance relationship and I understood it and continue my life, my dad is literally a millionaire with lots of money  and I’m starting colleague in one month, here colleague is not that expensive depending where you study and my college is kind of cheap because I told my dad that I didn’t really care about where I do college at the end I just want that paper title and do my job well, I have practically all my life solved and shit but I still don’t know how to find love and I neither have a single group of friends, I separately have just 6-7 friends in total and just one of them I can call a true friend, I don’t know the others well or their lives, even that I know them from many years ago I just happened to get along well with them and that’s it, i started becoming more social two months and a half ago because of that girl I met at that time and a cousin of mine who coach me with that, i have been getting fun lately since that two months and a half until the present time but things won’t be sugar candy long enough because my cousin’s dad who is my uncle will get out of jale and he wants me and everyone at my house death, he already tried to kill us twice over the years sending us hitmans to go and find us, yeah he did it meanwhile in jail who the hell knows where he got the money from to hire them, so he is gonna be legally out in a few months but this time he will be the one killed by his enemies because he went to prision for kidnapping the daughter of a Power national family and that pissed off a very powerful man who is or was the father of that girl and i don’t think he will receive him with hugs, so yeah there’s a low chance that i could die being full body shot out of no where meanwhile I drive, walking or whatever place I happen to be at the moment, that’s how it works, right now I’m just thinking in make friends, get a girl, chill and boxing, even with the world almost falling down around the corner im calm with it, life is just normal and sometimes to not get bored I have the action at the boxing gym and I want to be professional and have this feeling that I don’t care that much about my life, I just happened to saved myself from dying three times last week I was just about to crash directly with a bus that was coming directly at me the two of us speeding up directly face to face I skipped it by rudely moving the steering wheel and the second time sting a motor bike I took it to the air jumping 7 feet from the floor and that 440 pounds could ve land on my back but it didn’t I was lucky also I nearly fall in barbed wires which would ve decapited me or getting free expose my organs, I controlled the vehicle on time an saved me, I avoided death by pure instinct and reaction but almost every single day before sleep I think about my death and I never see myself beyond my thirties because I fear being left all alone i wouldn’t see joy in a all solitary life, if that happens I will inevitably obsess with something to keep my mind going, I have been with that though for the last two years I happen to loss completely myself in my mind wachting it clearly as a movie, that moment and my funeral, lately I do it as a way to remember myself that there are people that care about me and it’s unfair to just left them and  contradictorily I ve been putting myself in danger lately and none of that times something happened to me by pure luck, I played with luck, my dad, my closest friend and a two female friends told me to take care of myself and one told me that she doesn’t want me dead, my mom and my little sister died when I was 8 my parents were already divorced by that time, and my dad got married many times, my whole biological family is just a money hungry wasp nest and are by no way my family,  some members of my step family and my dad are my family, i started looking to hang out with people since two months ago and realized how isolated from everyone i was, I was literally a living robot with no life aside of responsabilities from every day and training, I found joyness to life not just boxing but the reality is that deep down i just don’t care about my own life and have to always cover my mind with all I can, I don’t know why but I constantly imagine myself dying young many times per week.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone this is the firt blog I ever writte in Reddit and for explain it better I will say how I got here with this story and how I feel that in resume is I’m care free if I don’t last long, at the present time Im not planning to kill myself even that I thinked and fantasized about it in the past no longer than half a year ago, i was always visualizing myself cover of blood sitting on the floor, resting my back in a wall in the middle of the sidewalk looking with a sincere smile of relief to the front of me and people just walking giving a short look with their eyes and then continue their way like nothing happened or taking one gun and shooting it in my brain just after writing a large note in many pages of a notebook, now im 18 years old, I have never done a mental evaluation with a profesional so is an unknown area for me, in august of 2018 I signed up for boxing at a local gym, my reasons were that I considered myself weak and I just couldn’t stand the idea and also to get a six pack so I could date a neighbor female friend of my same age that I liked since I was 12 and she knew about it but told me to get ripped or get a six pack because i didn’t conviced her enough by that time I already moved home but I still visited her, I enter for the first time to the gym and that first day and the next two weeks I was feeling like collapsing, my body was doing something that never in my life did except for ocasionally running for one hour two or three times per week playing with my neighbors who also were my friends, I took all that physical effort and continue training to get my reward but things didn’t turned well with her literally 16 days later because she liked other two dudes and I was just the second option after a dude that behaved similar to me but was way more taller and buff, i knew there’s no magic on Earth to be that bigger not with the body I had, two days later we stopped contact  until 6 months later in her birthday and she invited me one day before it just because my mom told her mom if I would be there or something, after that day we entirely stopped all kind of comunication and she completely ghosted me for life, after 4 years from 12-16 years old knowing each other, like complete strangers, after that I obsessed with training and couldn’t care less if I felt tired or physical pain I just wanted that rush of adrenaline to feel alive, I was in first year of high school but i was the quiet kid that is practically an invisible ghost for everyone except when there were team works, Sport classes or if I greeted or say bye to anyone, those were the only moments I was visible, there were times that just for no reason I walked around the hole classroom with a bag of candies that I bringed from home, and asked each one if they wanted some and also choose the ones they wanted, I felt like Santa doing that and I liked it even if no one from there would see me than nothing more than just some classmate fortunately no one bullied me, my dad frecuently  kept check on me, i live in a medium size coast city, also I live in Latin America,  my entire high school years were meh only thing exceptional has been boxing and a pretty quiet girl I liked and confessed once and naturally she gently rejected me after thinking her answer for a hole minute and then told me “ No, but I don’t want you to feel bad”, and i had completely Zero nothing to do with her and spended the next three months looking at each other and then the year ended ,  literally that’s all from that there’s nothing more about high school that I could even care a microscopic piece about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two months and a half ago I met and lived my first romance story in my entire life and gave my firsts kisses with her, I felt so unstoppable and happy, i felt like i found the light of grace with her, and I could just not stop of holding hands and hugging her meanwhile she beautifully smiled at me and returned the hugs and took my hand in her waist to hold her, sadly she lives in another city at 82 miles from my city I know doesn’t look that much but the road is like two hours driving and she is no willing to have a long distance relationship and I understood it and continue my life, my dad is literally a millionaire with lots of money  and I’m starting colleague in one month, here colleague is not that expensive depending where you study and my college is kind of cheap because I told my dad that I didn’t really care about where I do college at the end I just want that paper title and do my job well, I have practically all my life solved and shit but I still don’t know how to find love and I neither have a single group of friends, I separately have just 6-7 friends in total and just one of them I can call a true friend, I don’t know the others well or their lives, even that I know them from many years ago I just happened to get along well with them and that’s it, i started becoming more social two months and a half ago because of that girl I met at that time and a cousin of mine who coach me with that, i have been getting fun lately since that two months and a half until the present time but things won’t be sugar candy long enough because my cousin’s dad who is my uncle will get out of jale and he wants me and everyone at my house death, he already tried to kill us twice over the years sending us hitmans to go and find us, yeah he did it meanwhile in jail who the hell knows where he got the money from to hire them, so he is gonna be legally out in a few months but this time he will be the one killed by his enemies because he went to prision for kidnapping the daughter of a Power national family and that pissed off a very powerful man who is or was the father of that girl and i don’t think he will receive him with hugs, so yeah there’s a low chance that i could die being full body shot out of no where meanwhile I drive, walking or whatever place I happen to be at the moment, that’s how it works, right now I’m just thinking in make friends, get a girl, chill and boxing, even with the world almost falling down around the corner im calm with it, life is just normal and sometimes to not get bored I have the action at the boxing gym and I want to be professional and have this feeling that I don’t care that much about my life, I just happened to saved myself from dying three times last week I was just about to crash directly with a bus that was coming directly at me the two of us speeding up directly face to face I skipped it by rudely moving the steering wheel and the second time sting a motor bike I took it to the air jumping 7 feet from the floor and that 440 pounds could ve land on my back but it didn’t I was lucky also I nearly fall in barbed wires which would ve decapited me or getting free expose my organs, I controlled the vehicle on time an saved me, I avoided death by pure instinct and reaction but almost every single day before sleep I think about my death and I never see myself beyond my thirties because I fear being left all alone i wouldn’t see joy in a all solitary life, if that happens I will inevitably obsess with something to keep my mind going, I have been with that though for the last two years I happen to loss completely myself in my mind wachting it clearly as a movie, that moment and my funeral, lately I do it as a way to remember myself that there are people that care about me and it’s unfair to just left them and  contradictorily I ve been putting myself in danger lately and none of that times something happened to me by pure luck, I played with luck, my dad, my closest friend and a two female friends told me to take care of myself and one told me that she doesn’t want me dead, my mom and my little sister died when I was 8 my parents were already divorced by that time, and my dad got married many times, my whole biological family is just a money hungry wasp nest and are by no way my family,  some members of my step family and my dad are my family, i started looking to hang out with people since two months ago and realized how isolated from everyone i was, I was literally a living robot with no life aside of responsabilities from every day and training, I found joyness to life not just boxing but the reality is that deep down i just don’t care about my own life and have to always cover my mind with all I can, I don’t know why but I constantly imagine myself dying young many times per week.&lt;/p&gt;

I fucked up during my first 2 years of college, blindingly falling in love with a women that was using me for 2 years...but Ignored many of my friends telling me of this because there is ""no way someone could do something that cruel"". I changed as a person and that made me lose many of my friends especially one of my closest best friends after a heated argument we got into. It's been about 1.5 years and my only social contact left is my family and younger brother.

I've become a fucking ghost on social media developing an odd behavior of taking weeks to respond to someones snapchat message/IG message which also greatly contributed to the death of my social life. I dont know what to do anymore to fix this.

\&gt;I failed my social life

\&gt;My grades have tanked in college dramatically

\&gt;I failed my ambitions of going to medical school, basically shitting on my now deceased mentor who guided me on my path to my goal

\&gt;My day for the last 1.5 years has consisted of waking up, doing ZOOM UNI, going to the gym, and sleeping

\&gt;My younger brother has a better social life then I do, a fucking embarrassment..

\&gt;Im a 21 year old fucking loser who didnt realize his mistakes till it was too late and will be punished for them

I have seriously lost all ambitions and hope of fixing this disaster. It's over for me and the only way out is ending this shit. The only thing left keeping me afloat is the hard acceptance of the eternal pain I will cause to my loving family. I dont know what to do anymore, I reached out to that best friend I mentioned earlier several months ago and took full blame for the conflict we got into but it has never been the same again. We came to terms but that's it, nothing else has happened.

This is not a secret to my family as well as in my senior year of highschool ( I wont go into the details why) but I tried to take my own life and my mom and brother caught me. I promised I was just drunk but it was total bullshit and this happened 4ish years ago before my life turned around temporarily. 

This depression is nothing new in my bloodline as one of my relatives also took his life in a similar situation, unfortunately my bloodline has been crushed by suicide. I will follow the path soon as well, I cant take this shit any longer, I played the wrong moves and there is no more hope. I hope the rest of you who suffer from depression get a turning point in your lives soon.

Anyways, I know I might do something I might regret, and that I need help. But I'm afraid that if I do go to my foster parents (who have treated me with kindness the whole time) that they might be disappointed or that the system might remove me.

Before it was being afraid of the consequences when I go home, but now I'm with people that I value. I care about what they think. And I don't want to leave.

I know the crisis inpatient places don't help me. Most make me feel worse to the point that I lie a week or two in.

I feel like I need to try residential, but at the same time I don't want to leave my new home. I turn 18 in December, and I didn't expect to love past 13. 

I know here I have a better chance at a good life, and part of my brain says that thing will be fine, to push through. It's said that for years.

But it hasn't. Things havnt been fine my whole life, and I don't see the point in living. I don't value my life, and I've tried to end it a few times and I'm addicted to self harm in multiple forms. When I got here I this plethora of positive emotions in a sense, like ""oh wow these people are nice"" or ""I don't have to be scared"" ""I can have an opinion""etc.

But it wore off. Because depression and mental illness doesn't go away.

I don't trust myself anymore, and one part of me wants help and hates the cons, and another part just wants to wait until I snap again.

I’m a 23 year old female and I’ve been struggling with depression since I was 8 years old.

We all lived together. My mum lives with my brother who she cares for as he is severely disabled and I live 5 hours away from them as I came down here for uni but now I have a job and a mortgage here. The past few weeks things have started up again and I have no idea why. It used to be I was the one she would say everything to but now I’m not there and I feel so guilty. I’ve not been able to travel up as much due to COVID and my brother being easily affected by it.

I’m a 23 year old female and I’ve been struggling with depression since I was 8 years old. My mum has also been struggling and throughout my life she has always said to me how she wants to walk in front of traffic and die, leave everyone around her etc. It stopped for a few years back in 2016 when my dad passed away, then my grandad and in 2019 my granny passed away as well. We all lived together. My mum lives with my brother who she cares for as he is severely disabled and I live 5 hours away from them as I came down here for uni but now I have a job and a mortgage here. The past few weeks things have started up again and I have no idea why. It used to be I was the one she would say everything to but now I’m not there and I feel so guilty. I’ve not been able to travel up as much due to COVID and my brother being easily affected by it. But I was planning on going up in a couple of weeks and I told her this and yesterday she said to me she doesn’t want me up anymore and she doesn’t want to see me anymore either.

&amp;#x200B;

Three years ago now i embarked on a lifestyle adventure, i wanted a purpose in life and i found it, i quickly became an advocate for my countries traditional values, i wanted to make sure that none of this stuff died out, but not even two years someone who calls himself prime minister said up yours to me and others with the same interest, i was forced to see all my favorite shops be bankrupted and some of them even redeveloped into retarded flats for these new retards to live in, i was forced to see history smashed before my very eyes, what do they want out of this torture?

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are of no use, they have pro-lockdown and pro-restriction views, everytime a lockdown is proposed they jump on the bandwagon screaming 'yes! YES! YES!' and call them names every time even an ounce of freedom is given back, they just don't understand, they never will.

&amp;#x200B;

The lockdowns have ruined me, i'm depressed inconfident wreck who can't even speak properly anymore, i've all but lost one of my teeth, and it's not as if i can go out and have fun, a dying or dead shop has to be seen, or a social area has to be closed off somewhere because oH No IT cAN SPreAD ViRUS!!!! i'm mask exempt for a reason, because if i was forced to, i would have done it already by now.

&amp;#x200B;

As it is they are trying to justify another lockdown in a few months, they want to remove some restrictions but all the pro-restrictioners are going crazy, including my parents, listen, you idiots, i don't want to live in a dystopian world.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that if there is a lockdown 4 and restrictions are kept, i may not be alive by this time next year, during the first lockdown i tried by *accidently* choking on the awful food i was forced to eat while my parents were watching the weekly propaganda broadcast, some times i wish i succeeded.

&amp;#x200B;

But my religion says you can't do suicide, and i look at my artwork and all the good things i've done for humanity and decide it's not worth it, but still though i'm an awful person who doesn't deserve anything left that even vaguely makes me happy, i've even considered buying stupid material possessions like kilts to get my mind off it, it will never work, all i know is that *IT'S THE END OF THE LINE* for me and people like me, i'll either have to find something else to do, or go.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over a year ago now they wrecked my life with a series of lockdowns and restrictions on social movement for some virus, and they didn&amp;#39;t care, they took everything i loved off me, and all they wanted to do was protect they&amp;#39;re stupid little hospitals, yea people were dying and still are, but i don&amp;#39;t give a damn it&amp;#39;s not my problem, i didn&amp;#39;t cause it, it&amp;#39;s not my fault but you still blamed us and wrecked our lives over it! breeded an anti-social generation and locked us up, created a set of restrictions that you and other idiots want in forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years ago now i embarked on a lifestyle adventure, i wanted a purpose in life and i found it, i quickly became an advocate for my countries traditional values, i wanted to make sure that none of this stuff died out, but not even two years someone who calls himself prime minister said up yours to me and others with the same interest, i was forced to see all my favorite shops be bankrupted and some of them even redeveloped into retarded flats for these new retards to live in, i was forced to see history smashed before my very eyes, what do they want out of this torture?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents are of no use, they have pro-lockdown and pro-restriction views, everytime a lockdown is proposed they jump on the bandwagon screaming &amp;#39;yes! YES! YES!&amp;#39; and call them names every time even an ounce of freedom is given back, they just don&amp;#39;t understand, they never will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lockdowns have ruined me, i&amp;#39;m depressed inconfident wreck who can&amp;#39;t even speak properly anymore, i&amp;#39;ve all but lost one of my teeth, and it&amp;#39;s not as if i can go out and have fun, a dying or dead shop has to be seen, or a social area has to be closed off somewhere because oH No IT cAN SPreAD ViRUS!!!! i&amp;#39;m mask exempt for a reason, because if i was forced to, i would have done it already by now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it is they are trying to justify another lockdown in a few months, they want to remove some restrictions but all the pro-restrictioners are going crazy, including my parents, listen, you idiots, i don&amp;#39;t want to live in a dystopian world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that if there is a lockdown 4 and restrictions are kept, i may not be alive by this time next year, during the first lockdown i tried by &lt;em&gt;accidently&lt;/em&gt; choking on the awful food i was forced to eat while my parents were watching the weekly propaganda broadcast, some times i wish i succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

So every day, I try my best to make him just as happy as he has made me.

But there is something that I can't make him happy with. He told me that his family is abusive, and his classmates bully him (for clarification, we are both high school students). His father beats him up regularly, and his mother screams at him and insults him all the time. When he got bad grades at school, he started receiving death threats from his relatives. He also has no friends in school, and literally everyone in his class bullies him, calls him names, and he gets beaten up there too. 

To add to that, his family is in poverty, and he's failing several school subjects, because of all the stress being put on him. He only has online friends, but recently, he has been losing those, too. And to top it all off, his health isn't good, either, since he has heart, lung, bone problems, way too many allergies.... it saddens me so much to see him being subjected to so much suffering. My heart is broken from the frustration that I can't do anything about it all. The most I can do is sit behind the computer, and listen as he tells me what names he has been called that day. It hurts.

Just today, he has been subject to 40+ minutes of getting screamed at by his mother. Right after that, he mentioned suicide to me. When I asked him to clarify, he told me that just a few days earlier, he attempted to off himself, and he has been thinking of attempting again ever since. He just didn't tell me, because he didn't want to worry me. 

At that point, I had a panicked breakdown, and after calming down, I helplessly begged him to hold on a little longer. I told him that he matters a lot to me, and I care about him a lot. I told him that I'll be right there for him with open arms and ears whenever he needs me, even if not physically. I told him that one day, he can say goodbye to his classmates and family, and never has to see them again. But he wasn't convinced.

Although he isn't sure whether to go through with it at the moment, right now, I am worried sick about him. I just wish I could make him happy somehow. I wish I could just make him feel a *bit* better somehow. *Any*how. But I can't. I feel so helpless and frustrated.

I remember my mother asked me to get a good average; I had straight A’s for the rest of my life. I was never in trouble, never started fights and was always willing and happy. I loved myself, even though for the majority of my life I was poor and made fun of.

Then something changed; my mother stopped caring. I had no father and she spent most of her time and money showering her boyfriends. She put my needs aside. 

I barely ate, I barely had clothes, and she stopped showing up to the honors ceremonies and stopped filling out school paperwork. I was all alone now.

It was like she was on drugs, she started stealing the little money that I had, and she would force me to spend time with her boyfriends that hated my guts. All I wanted was to be either treated fairly or left alone. She even wouldn’t let me sleep in on weekends, ruining my sleep patterns and making me work harder in school.

After graduating from college my grandmother and uncle teamed up on me and forced me into the streets, my mom didn’t care. This is little, harmless me; not some violent thug drug dealer that’s being abused.

I want to die because my mom wants me dead. She has picked on me and made me a fool long enough. I literally had no one in my corner except her and she abandoned me.

I live in her house; I overheard her say that she was gonna turn my room into a wash room. She was 13-14 when she had me and could not/did not raise a boy to be a man. I came so far and had so much success, only to have it all stripped away.

I really hate her now, as much as she hates me; and because my situation is so extremely toxic, I gotta escape. I was supposed to be so successful but she held me back on purpose like a slave that she is.

She clowns me to her friends for having no money when it’s her fault; which is embarrassing. I bought a nice BB gun, a big bottle of vodka, and am getting sleeping pills tomorrow. Which way to is the question for now.

I listen to a lot of Biggie, Tupac, Nirvana, and Jimi Hendrix who were all suicidal, so that helps.

You would think that a quiet honor student would be respected by his single parent mother, but her jealousies have gotten the best of me.

There is something called “black blood;” It’s a suicide theory that I create. When two random families get together and have a child, the child has black blood; it’s not a unique blood, it’s the blood of two separate families that have come together . It’s up to the parents to love and nurture that blood into warm red blood. If the bloods don’t mix and become one, the person with black blood becomes suicidal. My blood is still black because my mother and fathers families have conflicted.

And that’s why I want to die .

I've dealt with suicidal ideations/attempts for half my life, been hospitalized twice in the late 2010s for those reasons, where I got my bipolar diagnosis. I live in an unsupportive environment that I cannot afford to leave as I would do even worse, so I need to plan on how to do that but I see so few options. I'm trans and working on starting HRT, but the second I become more open about my identity my current living situation can become forfeit.

I find it hard to form interpersonal relationships of any kind, but this one seemed so natural and I truly trusted her and was legitimately happy, not in an unrealistic way I knew things weren't and never would be perfect, but I truly felt at peace and that so long as we had each other that makes anything else worth it. 

I've had a history of being abandoned by people in this way, but this time has really left its mark and internalized the feelings and thoughts of worthlessness I always had. they are just facts now, and I can't truly trust anybody new regardless of the kind of interpersonal relationship.

The stress of it along with the other issues has me spiraling worse and worse. I can't even talk to someone irl about it, cause if i were honest I'd get hospitalized again, lose my job, have to pay those bills,etc.

Thank you all for your input. I feel, well, refreshed! 

I've tried to commit suicide over 15 times in the past 10 years. I'm 25. Thanks to my heavy manipulation and lying about my mental state, I was able to stay out of institutions. With all my conditions, physical and mental, entering an institution would likely result in an even worse outcome. I hate my freedom being attacked by institutionalizion. After certain suicide attempts, and many hours of talking, I managed to manipulate my way out of the system. 
My main question is, regarding your religion, what happens when someone kills themselves? What happens to their soul? 
I do not see any point in remaining, so I'd  really like to find out what happens AFTER death. Religious buffs definitely have an answer, as survivors who have flatlined. I want to know religious aspects and others. Will I be reborn as a baby in an impoverished family? Would I be stuck in lingo until I could be reborn again? Really I am just looking for answers from people who have met death's door. Or people who have religious ideas on the matter. I am, literally dying to find out this information.
Thank you to anyone with a helpful answer.

I’m not okay right now. I’ve tried to call and chat for help, but no one is saying anything that reaches me. It makes me scared that I’m too far in, and I’m not going to be able to get through this one.

I’m sorry, I know it’s not anyone’s burden but mine own. And I really don’t want to write this. But . . . I’d like some help. Some kind words, or stupid jokes, or memes, or shitposting, or something. Anything, really.

Reddit is one of the few places I feel welcome and understood. If anyone out there could please just send me a thought, give me something to cling on to while I try to push through this, it would mean more than I can possibly explain in words.

I'm sorry but this might be a long post. So from present day I am 13 years old turning 14 in a month or so. I've done so many horrible things in my life and it hardly even started. 
I was bullied some like most kids, but it wasn't much, all that really happened was that I was called ugly a few times but nothing that matters. In a result of that and everything that happened so far, at the age of 6 I believe I fat shamed a kid once and never did that again. Kids were to step on my hands as well because I was protecting a colony of ants, which apparently made me the weird ""girl"". As a kid my parent didn't care much for me or at least It didn't seem like it to me.
My dad and my mom are split up, never married. The reason for that is that my dad is very abusive to my mom, he did horrible things to her that I dont think my mom would like me to explain but within the things that he did to her could've effected me as well. My dad once kidnapped me when I was little for around 6 months and harassed my mom about some stuff. At the age of 3 my brother killed himself, he was 18 and he was a great person from what I've been told, always open, kind, and helpful. My mom never really showed me affection just fed me and bought me clothes but hardly ever hugged me and she always thought I was a bully from what the school had said to her.
I'll admit I was a little but only because of my bad anger issues that I still have problems with. Well enough of that, I'll just explain why I feel like an horrible person. 

As I said earlier, I was a bit of a bully, along with that I've smoked, shoplifted, committed arson and watch porn. The only reason why I did arson, smoked and watch porn was because there was this one girl in my neighborhood that I looked up to and she would tell me to do things like smoke and start fires. She even told to search up porn on the internet, i would always listen to her... and I regret it. I regret all of the things I've done. I hate myself for all of this that I have said. I've watched porn so much that it droved me to do the wrose thing possible... I made my dog lick my down there, and that's why I was here before... but ever sense than I can't stop thinking about all the things I've did in the past and the more I think about the more I wish to die. I really hope that when I do die I get the most painful death there is.
I wish nothing good for me... I've shoplift because I felt ugly and I wanted to look nice so I took things that I was scared to ask my mom to get for me.. I took things that could hurt me as well.. because I feel as if I need to be punished and because my mom keeps taking my blades from me.. 
I know must of this sounds unbelievable and like im seeking attention but I really am not.. I just don't know what to do anymore and I'm scared that I'm just like my dad.. i really don't wanna be a bad person or anything..but even so I know I am. I never had a normal childhood, I would always hurt everyone and everything, I even hurted my mom and her dog...I just hate myself so much and I wish I was loved and cared for growing up. I really hope I die soon not to end the pain but because I dont want to end up like my dad, I don't want to be abusive and disgusting, idont want to be a drug addict, I want to be everything he's not.. part of me hates him because of the things he did to my mom... I know all the things I have done in my life were wrong and I feel extremely guilty for all of them.. I feel like such a bad person, like there's no hope for me.. all I am is a selfish, rude, stupid, useless person that should've known better than to do any of that.

I am M middle 20’s
Small town 150k ish
My life has been a struggle from an early age, I will not go into any real detail but I have only a few good memories of my dad and mom (separated before my birth mother married another man who is my step dad before my birth) I could only maybe count 4-6 memories total that are positive then it’s just a big blank of neglect and darkness. We were poor and meals were rare unless it was dinner (she at least made dinner once a day for us) I don’t recall much of my stepdad but he was busy working (truck driver) and supporting us while my mother stayed at home for the early years to care for us. (House was generally dirty and I was sometimes made fun of for my clothes appearance and smell) I was able to make friends albeit I’m awkward sort of and they helped a lot to keep me above water.(I made most friends through sports/gym class) my family was generally nice people but a lot of skeletons as some families due.
My relationship to my mother was that of a depressed women who struggles to stay afloat and manage while my relationship to my father was that of terror and abuse, he was very violent and i did fear for my life around him. I told my family at 4 years old that he was physically abusive towards me but when it was investigated I guess they didn’t believe me.(I think my memory is very bad earlier then 10 years old) I do remember him knocking me so hard that everything went black and I woke up later on I’m not sure how long though. My family in general treated me like an outsider(or so it felt and we did celebrate holidays together on either side of the family which were fun)

At 18, things started looking up. I don't make friends often but I like to think when I do, it's because they're people I can develop a *meaningful* friendship with. I found a group pf pals Sophomore year who I still talk to. I started working out more, my grades were a non issue, I was going places and laughing my ass off with my friends and looking forward to finally moving out and going to college. I'm the type of person that does well with people in my corner, otherwise I feel like a lost cause. That's why my grades turned around once I had friends. Had a real ""I can't wait to get out of here"" attitude, my younger self was naive but he had a dream. A future he'd always aspire to, It's what makes me take all the cringy teenager stuff with a grain of salt. Can't say I have that now. 




1)  Heartbreak 

It all started when I foolishly developed feelings for a friend. We knew eachother since kindergarten and slowly started talking more over the years. She knew and kinda teased me about it. She would make jokes about how I had a crush on her and whatnot and we'd both laugh about it. We both had bad home lives and some similar interests. In person, we'd make all types of dumb jokes and sometimes stay up till 3 in the morning texting. Whenever things were bothering her, I always wanted to help. Just seeing her happy was enough. I started working out because of her and although I never got ripped, it gave me some degree of confidence.

All in all, I've moved on and she's become someone who I don't want to talk to anymore. I knew I was a huge idiot simp but at the time I was just happy to talk to someone who I meshed well with. Everyday was an opportunity to see her laugh or what things she would say next. I was really unattractive and had still have low self esteem. She was smart and funny and seemed to light up everyone she came in contact with. We both knew we'd never get together and it's behind me but at the moment it really stung. I've had dumb crushes before but I never actually talked to any of them or knew them as a person, just thought a girl was pretty. I can honestly say she was the first person I've ever loved. For who she was, her mind and her convictions. She's changed now. She ended up dumping her boyfriend of six years for access to hookup sex and drugs. We haven't talked for a long time because I felt the need to walk out of her life and quit causing myself heartache. I was a virgin then, I'm still one now. But I want to be very clear, it's never sex that I wanted, I want to the supportive and fulfilling context a relationship provides. 

2)  Parents

My parents have always been unsupportive. I don't want to blame them too much, there's definitely worse out there and they do what they provide for me, but I definitely can't rely on them for any kind of emotional support or help with my problems. I feel like they don't see me as a person, just a tool. Like a proximal appendage meant to fulfill their own lives. A parent should help their kid understand life and give them the basis of knowledge to operate as a functional member of society, not use them to like a utility. My parents hardly ever teach me anything about how the world worked, like driving or finding a job, and when they do: they're screaming at me and insulting me. I honestly think they don't even want me to have my own life, it's the same thing George Carlin was saying: they just want obedient workers.

They take every chance to belittle, mistreat, guilt trip and manipulate me that they can. If I'm depressed, it's because I'm ""lazy."" My dad had a temper problem when I was growing up, he once smacked me in the side of my arm with the broad side of a machete when I was young because for whatever reason I wasn't picking the weeds the way he wanted. I talked to my counselor at that age about how strict my parents were which of course led child services to our door, after they left my parents continued to find a way to blame this on me. They forced me to go to prom when I made it clear that I was very uncomfortable going to. I had no date and hated the low budget pretentious high school bs. The whole preprom they wanted to show me off like a toy and feed me backhanded compliments so I just talked to my friends instead. All that happened there was my allergic reaction to the food and seeing the girl I liked lock lips with a dude who wasn't me. When the prom bus came back, My parents left me in the freezing rain at 3AM because I was ""disrespectful"" because of course. Stuff like this only ever happens to me. It set this precedent in me, the people I'm told I'm SUPPOSED to trust I can't even rely on.

3) College 1 and Death of Grandma

After that, I graduated. I got a letter from the art school I had applied to. It had closed down and they had to move me into the online division. I already told the other potential schools I applied to that I decided to go to this one and it was too late to renew applications. I was extremely pissed when I got that letter, but my parents didn't exactly seem to care as usual. Online school was the biggest rip off I had ever seen in my life. It was scummy they could charge so much for professors that never responded to emails or graded anything. My grades tanked and I felt used. Kicked around and bullied by greedy corporations wringing me for money I didn't have. February into my freshman year: that entire institution closed nationwide because  they were in that much trouble with the piss poor quality of their classes and tuition.

At the same time as dealing with this econmic stress, my grandmother had gotten very very ill. She was the only person in my family that was always nice to me. She had a blockage in some part of her heart and didn't have very long to live because her age was a death sentence had they ever operated on her. We would stay at her nursing home for hours (which was the most depressing atmosphere on the planet, it smelled like sour fermented fecal matter and death, mostly because that's what you were actually smelling). I missed assignments because of it. I would have to lie to her face and tell her I was doing okay it school. Her funeral was about a week before that online school closed for good so I didn't even get a full year in. During the time leading up to her death, I reached out to all my friends for help. Most of them were supportive. That girl in the first couple paragraphs was always someone who I would talk about life troubles with, both hers and mine. She accused me of being too whiny and to this day that kind of fucked me up. I use apps like ifunny and reddit to vent my problems unironically because I'm scared of people thinking I'm annoying or whiny. I legitimately try to make myself as scarce as possible, so as not to be a bother to anyone. During this time, I remember really trying to improve as an artist, but after I lost my grandmother something in me broke and I couldn't find it in me to draw until after summer ended.


4) 2019

After art school ""ended"" I spent the rest of 2019 until November kind of being a NEET. I lost contact with most of my friends, I tried to find a job at various places only to have my application ignored or fail the interview. I literally have zero work experience even at the time of writing this. I shut in and played video games all day, I didn't even draw like I used to, when I tried I would just hate everything I made. Things were at a low point. Days bled together, I had lost all purpose, sometimes I slept for hours and hours. I woukd play things like Kitchen Nightmares and ASMR for long periods of time just to hear another person talk. The silence was deafening and that silence still follows me around today. I feel like nobody around really cares about me.

Around this time, I stopped working out. My health started to get worse and I gained about 20 pounds.

5) College 2

 I was eventually forced to go back into a community college by my mother, I wasn't really interested in anything other than Psychology and didn't want to do art again. I chose Psych because I was actually half decent at that. In high school, I actually scored a 5/5 on the AP Psychology test thanks to the teachings of an awesome teacher. He was the best teacher I ever knew. He was always visibly excited about his material, he would tell funny annecdotes but always went in depth with discussion of the material, it was already interesting but he elevated it, really made you understood it, commended everyone and applauded them for grasping the concepts. He was the type that genuinely made you believe in yourself. Made you believe he actively thought that you had everything in you you needed to succeed. To this  very day, he's still my role model and who I want to be when I ""grow up."" He once told me that if he had a son, he would want him to be exactly like me. The dude is my hero but I was one of the quiet kids, he wouldn't remember me. When I applied, I was reminded of him and it made me sad. He expressly told us not to apply to this college for whatever reason. At this point, most of my friends were already 2 years in. I worried what he'd think of me if he knew how little I'd accomplished with my life, I still do. I was dragged along on a vacation before college started and it gave me IBS that I only got over recently (about 2 years), even the vacation felt selfish in nature, unconcerned about what I was going through. 

6) College 2 and Covid

This college wasn't ideal but I didn't complain too much. I had a ""it was better than nothing"" and ""its something to do"" stance about the situation. 
I didn't have transportation available so I had to be picked up and dropped off at specific times. So I would be stuck on campus for hours but I didn't mind. There was enough time to get my work done, draw and just laze around watching critical role on my phone. I still missed my friends, I was still bored, felt lost and dissatisfied with life. But honestly, after all I had gone through, it was a sliver of stability after all the things I had been through before. My grades were managable and my parents were off my case. I stayed there for about October 2019 to March 2020 when the pandemic hit. This reverted us back to online learning where my grades suffered, failing 2 classes and my parents railed me for them.

I saw this preemptively and tried to switch to part time and find a first job, but my controlling parents didn't let me. Something about the online format is incredibly frustrating, it's 4x the workload of regular classes yet the teachers never grade anything. It's like death by a thousand cuts. Once you're caught behind, you can't catch up. After my second failed class, my parents threatened to kick me out (during a pandemic too). Luckily, I made the decision to take a smaller number of classes this past semester (4 ---&gt; 5) and got all A's, still the lack of support is killing me. This February I messed up my wrist and thumb with all the snow we get here, and it's paining me since then, making it difficult to draw. I used up alot of money doing occupational therapy and it's still pained. The absolute dickhead of a doctor did nothing for me. With this doctor, I just get this nagging feeling in the back of my head that I'm always annoying someone simply by existing and they're just trying to get over talking to me as soon as possible. He didn't even give me a name for the condition of my wrist. He gave me a form to write about scheduling an MRI, (which I couldn't take because my insurance turned down) HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO WRITE IT WHEN I HAVE A FUCKED UP HAND, IS ANYONE LISTENING TO ME!? YOUR JOB IS TO HELP ME AND YOU DON'T EVEN CARE 

It's managlable now, I can still draw but I can barely make a fist. If something hits it the wrong way, my thumb completely locks up and tightens. I'm praying to Jesus it will heal.

That semester lasted from August 2020 to May 2021. Bringing us to a out where I'm at now in my summer break. I tell people I'm just trying to take it easy but honestly I'm exhausted and have no idea what I'm doing.


7) Present Day

I don't know what I'm doing anymore. My life has never felt this pointless. In four years I've done nothing but fail over and over and over again, banging my head against a wall and bleeding. I want to scream. I want to cry but tears won't come out. I feel like God has abandoned and forsaken me. 

I don't know what I'm here for anymore. I used to fantasize about an idealistic personal future, something everyone does. Dream about having a big house, a beautiful smart wife, two kids and a dog. Something to strive for, keep me going. That only brings me pain now cause Ive given up on that as a possibility. It feels like I'm supposed to fail, that misery in inescapable. That I'm an NPC in a video game and the goal is finding exceedingly contrived reasons for me to kill myself.

I STILL haven't been kissed, found a girlfriend or lost my virginity.

I STILL haven't gotten a job.

I STILL haven't moved out.

I STILL haven't accomplished anything.

Any kind of mobility feels impossible and that the entire universe is so opposed to me that it's actively trying to erradicate me and scatter me to the four winds. Nothing ever works but something always goes wrong.

I'm still around but, man, I'm just running on fumes now with how tiring everything has been for 4 years constantly. I don't want to try anymore. Some part of me eroded away and whats walking forward into a bleak and empty future I hate is just the composite skeleton of what's left of me. Everything I tried to do to better things has blown up in my face, I'm a lost cause a bad investment and tired of trying to fix it.

I wake up everyday and hate the useless, stupid, worthless, hideous, repulsive person I see in the mirror. And engage in a pointless, hapless, miserable, painful life. The only thing that ever seems guaranteed is loneliness and unfulfillment, I feel completely lost and hopeless. I feel so tired of waiting around for things to get better because they're not going to. On a serious note, I'm probably too chickenshit and worthless to even actually attempt suicide but that's yet another thing I fail at. I can't even die right and save everyone the trouble. I don't even know if I want to, but at the end of the day, things won't get better. Everything will only get worse. And still, I'm just gonna get empty platitudes about ""your life is only bad because youre so negative"" like some ""positive attitude"" will magically fix all my problems. I'm  negative BECAUSE of my life. People keep saying to keep trying, but it never changes anyway. Just like everything else, the hours I spent typing this will ultimately lead to nothing but the reality of things is that nobody cares about me, no matter what I do I will never matter.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a rough four years for me since High School ended. Things were always bad but they never felt this needlessly cruel. Please bear with me if this post is too long.

Luckily, I made the decision to take a smaller number of classes this past semester (4 ---&amp;gt; 5) and got all A&amp;#39;s, still the lack of support is killing me. This February I messed up my wrist and thumb with all the snow we get here, and it&amp;#39;s paining me since then, making it difficult to draw. I used up alot of money doing occupational therapy and it&amp;#39;s still pained. The absolute dickhead of a doctor did nothing for me. With this doctor, I just get this nagging feeling in the back of my head that I&amp;#39;m always annoying someone simply by existing and they&amp;#39;re just trying to get over talking to me as soon as possible.

&lt;p&gt;I STILL haven&amp;#39;t accomplished anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any kind of mobility feels impossible and that the entire universe is so opposed to me that it&amp;#39;s actively trying to erradicate me and scatter me to the four winds. Nothing ever works but something always goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still around but, man, I&amp;#39;m just running on fumes now with how tiring everything has been for 4 years constantly. I don&amp;#39;t want to try anymore. Some part of me eroded away and whats walking forward into a bleak and empty future I hate is just the composite skeleton of what&amp;#39;s left of me. Everything I tried to do to better things has blown up in my face, I&amp;#39;m a lost cause a bad investment and tired of trying to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wake up everyday and hate the useless, stupid, worthless, hideous, repulsive person I see in the mirror. And engage in a pointless, hapless, miserable, painful life. The only thing that ever seems guaranteed is loneliness and unfulfillment, I feel completely lost and hopeless. I feel so tired of waiting around for things to get better because they&amp;#39;re not going to. On a serious note, I&amp;#39;m probably too chickenshit and worthless to even actually attempt suicide but that&amp;#39;s yet another thing I fail at. I can&amp;#39;t even die right and save everyone the trouble. I don&amp;#39;t even know if I want to, but at the end of the day, things won&amp;#39;t get better. Everything will only get worse. And still, I&amp;#39;m just gonna get empty platitudes about &amp;quot;your life is only bad because youre so negative&amp;quot; like some &amp;quot;positive attitude&amp;quot; will magically fix all my problems. I&amp;#39;m  negative BECAUSE of my life. People keep saying to keep trying, but it never changes anyway. Just like everything else, the hours I spent typing this will ultimately lead to nothing but the reality of things is that nobody cares about me, no matter what I do I will never matter.&lt;/p&gt;

Im not contemplating this because Im depressed. (I am, but thats not the reason of this) 

Im a person to suppress emotions. Sadness, anger, i suppress them. It comes out every now and then. I take medications for depression, so sadness isn’t often.  Even then its only late at night and im fine by the morning.

But My anger. Thats what concerns me. Every release, it comes out stronger and stronger. At first its just a pillow punch. Recently its a hole in the wall. And it takes everything i have not to make more or scream at the top of my lungs. I have urges to lash my angers on others. Harm others. I already start to forget things when I get angry. I fear im going to spiral into a blinding anger.  Ive tried anger management. All they say is breath. Or count. It doesnt help.

I know where this anger comes from. 1. Stress. School, trying to live up to my fathers expectations, trying to make sure everyone else is happy, and a few others. Stress makes a portion of my breakouts. 2. Games. Mainly toxic players. They piss me off. Some days Im just not doing well. Or when things arent going the way they are supposed to. Like a quest for a boat race, its incredibly unstable. Cant turn right, but then im facing horizontal. 2 attempts im almost screaming its so stupid. Stop games? Games are  one of my ways to deal with depression. Even with meds it still can flow over. 3. My father. I dont even feel he deserves to be called that.  Sometimes its the lawn. I missed 4 inches of grass with the weed whacker. I get berated. The mower wont start. Its had SO many problems and he knows that. He gets home, it magically starts. Berated because Im damaging it and not using it properly. 

And then there are Jobs. He is impossible. I HAVE to get a job. Ive applied to 7. None responded. He tells me every day ‘call them’ show them you are dedicated and want the job. Otherwise you wont get a job. Every day its in a harsher tone or wording. Now it feels like insults.  He has a construction company, I tried working for a bit. With my brother, right now we are organizing materials and clearing trash. I set an alarm for. 5, missed it, woke at 7, left with brother. Organized, and we went to trash. All wood pallets. We had to lift them up the side of a dump truck. We tried. We couldnt do it. We did other things.

That night, (today) berated again. We are lazy asses because we went late. and we worked wednesday, then didnt thursday because we were dead tired and sore. I said I set an alarm, got yelled cuz Im lying. We CAN lift the pallets. They weigh less than us so we should lift it easily. Anything he can do, so can we. Hes out on sites daily. My brother works at arbys. I dont have a job. We dont lift every day. We CANT lift it. But hes too dense. He grew up on a farm, so he expects us to be able to do everything he could. 

And apparently we dont want jobs. We apply in hopes we dont get them. We are lazy and want to sit around and do nothing. (Thats only the basis but ive forgotten much of it from anger) all this because we went about an hour and a half later and couldn’t lift 80 pound pallets up a vertical surface. And he says he doesnt get much sleep, he’s exhausted, but he does that EVERY DAY. We dont. My sleep schedule is already screwed, I rarely get 4 hours. His response: we are making excuses. We are able to do everything. Because he can.

Im typing this with blood on my knuckles from punching things in my room. My anger is going out of control and I fear I endanger the safety of others.

I know I need help. Therapy is out of the window, they are still virtual and im scared to tell my family. I dont want them to gear this. Not yet. Not i til I can at least learn to calm down. Every time I try to, i get angrier. Music hurts my head. A simple game becomes infuriating.

I need help. But I dont know how to ask.

Im not in a tunnel where suicide is my only option. But its a constant thought that I keep having to push down, only for it to resurface.

And now present day, my uncle just died last night via an overdose on keyboard cleaner. I see no reason to keep trying so I’ll gladly be shooting myself tomorrow night. Any tips for where the muzzle should go would be appreciated. Not to mention I’ve already been cutting my wrists for years too.

I had dropped out of school because my mental health was a disaster, and I had run out of money. I had gotten a job, but I didn't make a ton and I was drinking and doing drugs on the daily.

4 years ago, I had moved out of my parents' place. I finally found a therapist I could work with. She encouraged me to start medication. I was still struggling a lot emotionally, but I was making progress in a direction. I had a group of friends. I had side projects and hobbies. I was not in a relationship, but  I was meeting people and doing things.

3 years ago, I felt ""human"" for the first time, maybe ever. I had been working with my therapist for a long time, I had medication that helped, I had a job that was interesting and engaging, and I was working on building good and healthy habits.

2 years ago, I was in a position to move across the country for a job that I really wanted, and I did. I had a new relationship and a job that I loved, and for the first time since I was a kid I felt happy and confident. I was confident enough to go off of my medication. I felt like I had finally made something of myself and was in a good place emotionally.

1 year ago, I had a different job and an unhealthy, emotionally unsafe, and failing relationship. I was working 80 hours per week and then spending my weekends helping my SO take care of her apartment and her pets.

6 months ago I had gotten fired and was yet again at a different job, and there was no more relationship.

5 months ago, the last close relationship in my life started slowly dying. My sibling came out as trans and while I absolutely love them and support them, it took a serious toll on our relationship - they began focusing almost exclusively on their new identity and community, and only wanted to talk about themselves and their new life. This was the only other person on the planet I could talk to about the emotional baggage caused the house we were raised in for 2 decades, and they wanted to put all of that behind them and kill off that version of themselves. Our regularly scheduled activities fell by the wayside as they got more involved with the people their newfound community, and our relationship naturally drifted apart. I was a thousand miles away, they were busy with a new identity and new friends.

4 months ago, I wanted to kill myself. I had been spiraling prior to that, and I was struggling to perform at work. I was exhausted constantly, and irritable. I was fired for the second time in 4 months. Doing basic things like feeding myself was a massive emotional and physical lift. I was completely alone, jobless, and stuck in an expensive city I didn't want to be in anymore.

3 months ago, I moved back into my parents' house. The same house and same parents that I've spent years in therapy trying to understand and heal from.

I'm 27 now. Over the last 3 months, I've fallen deeper and deeper into a suicidal depression. Last week I finally broke the wall and put together a plan. I got the stuff together and figured out time and place to end my own life. I am devastated. I hate that I feel this way, but I really think the pandemic and the lockdown ruined my life. It happened at such an unexpected and inopportune time, and has lasted *so* long. The world is in chaos, it was 118 degrees in the arctic circle this week, I'm trapped in a place that I hate and can barely function as a human being.

I really can't see the point. I don't deserve good things - they don't happen to me. When I hurt, I end up making the people around me hurt, in on way or another. I feel like I can't do this anymore. I just want to close my eyes and never wake up. There are things that are wrong with me emotionally that I don't even know where to begin fixing. If I am going to have a life I feel is worth living, it'll take another 5 years of dedicated hard work in therapy to get there. I'm exhausted. I just want this all to be over, so I can finally REST.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;5 years ago I was 22, living with my parents.

&lt;p&gt;4 months ago, I wanted to kill myself. I had been spiraling prior to that, and I was struggling to perform at work. I was exhausted constantly, and irritable. I was fired for the second time in 4 months. Doing basic things like feeding myself was a massive emotional and physical lift. I was completely alone, jobless, and stuck in an expensive city I didn&amp;#39;t want to be in anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 months ago, I moved back into my parents&amp;#39; house. The same house and same parents that I&amp;#39;ve spent years in therapy trying to understand and heal from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 27 now. Over the last 3 months, I&amp;#39;ve fallen deeper and deeper into a suicidal depression. Last week I finally broke the wall and put together a plan. I got the stuff together and figured out time and place to end my own life. I am devastated. I hate that I feel this way, but I really think the pandemic and the lockdown ruined my life. It happened at such an unexpected and inopportune time, and has lasted &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; long. The world is in chaos, it was 118 degrees in the arctic circle this week, I&amp;#39;m trapped in a place that I hate and can barely function as a human being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really can&amp;#39;t see the point. I don&amp;#39;t deserve good things - they don&amp;#39;t happen to me. When I hurt, I end up making the people around me hurt, in on way or another. I feel like I can&amp;#39;t do this anymore. I just want to close my eyes and never wake up. There are things that are wrong with me emotionally that I don&amp;#39;t even know where to begin fixing. If I am going to have a life I feel is worth living, it&amp;#39;ll take another 5 years of dedicated hard work in therapy to get there. I&amp;#39;m exhausted. I just want this all to be over, so I can finally REST.&lt;/p&gt;

sometime during the holidays i want to go to sleep and just not. wake up

because i'm scared of pain and that's why i want to leave this world, i want to stop hurting from all of life's grievances. every little thing. like the fact that no one invited me to go to the city after we finished (early) so i just went home instead, or the fact that my sister hates me for no reason and now she acts like she would prefer if i were dead, or that expectations make me want to scream and die, or that i got an a instead of an a plus and other people did better or the fact that sicne i'm asexual there's no point of me being here on earth.

it'd be way easier if i could just sleep forever. i walk home from school everyday after catching two buses and cross a road with six lanes. it would be nice if i could stop in the lane    but there's pain, and the possibility of survival.  it's clear that no one cares for me so what's the point of going out with a bang? if i could just disappear from people's lives and fade away like nothing, because i *am* nothing that would satisfy me.

i've always wanted to know what it's like after death. 

it's so hard to put my thoughts into text  because it makes so much more sense inside my head. 

ii can't cope with all this how do those people in the novels get throughh high school while simultaneously being in five extracurriculars and getting laid? i'm definitely not popular - not even at the point where i'm a theatre kid or play d&amp;d. fuck i don't even know how to play d&amp;d lmfao

i've read that overdosing is painful if you don't do it right. but there's nothing else i can possibly kms with in my house. it's australia, there are no guns. 

when i think about killing myself i feel better, more calm

when i think about death i feel better. if it were possible for me to give my life to someone who wanted to live but couldn't, i'd do it in a heartbeat.

ive been in a loop at starting work at 8pm, working till 2-3am, and not getting enough done. my productivity is expected to increase because im on the 2nd edition of my pip. i have 200 done right now out of 510 (I have do more than one task every minute, and increase every week, for my productivity goal). 

im suicidal because i read this book called “never be late again, 7 tips for the punctually challenged.” the 7 reasons are hurtful. there’s denial that being late is bad, denial over how much time something will take, denial over how to get motivated, denial over being able to “have it all” etc. The book constantly says that your friends hate it when you’re late. That you’re just undisciplined and just need to make a schedule and stick to it to build discipline. But then just tells you how to make the schedule but gives no guidelines on how to actually do what you’ve planned.

Anyway. The book says “discipline is the foundation of all the exercises.” And I wrote “well looks like I’m going to fail.” And then I read it all anyway instead of working, sobbing hysterically now at doing less than half of my work for the day at 1:30am. 

All of the schedules in the world won’t fucking stop me from procrastinating. Medicine. Amphetamines. SSRIs. APs. Thousands in therapy. Books. Physical beatings as a child. It took financial abuse for me to get my college degrees. It took psychological abuse for me to not give up for fear of disappointing my parents. I still live at home. My room is a mountain of trash. I haven’t showered in a week.

I do 1 thing and then I take a 4 hour break. It’s asinine. I can’t stop. I just need to cut myself. Maybe that will work. Did it work before? I don’t remember.

This is my story. I don't write well and I do apologize for this text.

I'm (30M) an immigrant (not going to disclose country), and I left my home, parents, and two siblings about four years ago (2017), to live with my current wife and to study engineering. I have graduated about two years ago and it was the best and the worst time of my life.

Two years ago, my father (59M) was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, a very aggressive type of brain cancer. At the same time, I was applying to renew my immigrant status and I couldn't leave the country since COVID-19, and everything was pretty much shutdown. Going back to my country was a big no, since It would fuck up my status. My mom and siblings, were the ones that actually did everything and helped him deal with cancer.

My father's first surgery was on the right side, and didn't affect him much. His doctor removed pretty much all that was possible, and he started the traditional chemo + radiotherapy treatment. At this time, my father was more alive than ever, he started fishing, exercising, and he even enrolled in some architecture classes (learning more about AutoCad and etc). My father had a lot of trouble dealing with AutoCad, and I offered him some help. We started sharing screens using Teams and he was not following up the step by steps. We had a lot of connectivity issues as well, always disconnecting, stuttering, losing audio and etc.

This is where I started with my stupid shit. I didn't realize that he was enjoying spending the time with me, and he wasn't giving to shits about AutoCad. However, I wanted him to excel and get his certification, so I would get very upset with him.

Fast forward 6 months, and his third MRI shows a huge mass on his left side, and two small masses close to cerebellum. He does his second surgery, much more aggressive. Now, he barely walks, he probably speaks three words a day, can't understand much, needs constant supervision, and I just had to help my mom clean him. 

I'm such a POS and probably the one that caused the cancer to spread, because I was fucking ranting about AutoCAD. I was finally able to come home to help my family this month. No need to say that my whole family is broken because of this fucking disease. 

I think this is my short story, the only thing holding me from actually pulling the trigger rn is my dad, which is probably sleeping in the other room.

I think my message is to not let small things upset you, because you might never hear an ""I love you"" ever again.

Can't get over, planned to die. 

[If the situation is resolved, this post will be deleted. If I have fully commited to suicide, I will delete this post too. Also, throwaway account to prevent my close ones from getting affected.] 

I'm sick of life, I'm sick of being nice. I can't bring myself to do something bad or revengeful, so I guess I'll just suicide. Friends find solving my situation a burdern. I lost what feels everything to me. I can't wait to suicide on my best friend (as I still do see her as) birthday (which maybe maybe happens to be tomorrow. I don't know if I would have decided by then.). I'm ready to be cancelled by the world. 

To be honest, I'm considered somewhat successful, in a fortunate country, in a higher than average income family. Unable to appreciate what I have, first world problems, am I right?


[Some irrelevant stuff]
I'm a selfish prick, I hate my family, I don't care about them. I get it, they raised me, I apologise I can't appreciate things. 

[Background]
I was born with Autism and I have depression, and was depressed for about my whole life. Even though happy things occured, I for some reason can't be not depressed. I only overcame depression temporarily because of my bestfriendship with Beverly (whom will be introduced later). 

[Pre-story]
I'll just share a stereotypical bestfriendship to feeling suicidal story. Just note that I have attempted suicide 3 times before 3 years ago (before 2018) 

There are 2 main people in this broken fairytale. Me and the fake name I shall call Beverly. Maybe at times in this post I'll call her B or something. 

Main - Myself [M] &amp; Beverly [F]
Side - Daisy [Beverly (also) best friend,] [F], Cassie (Beverly ex-girlfriend, LGBT) [F] 

[Main: Pre-relationship Era, 2018 May - 2019 Dec]
Beverly and I started to talk through some scholarship interview. These made us friends, and we became great friends after a few exchanges. I also made friends with Daisy, introduced through Beverly. Since my class only have 6 girls which consist 2 Malay and 4 Chinese and that the malays are 1 group and the chinese are split to 2 groups due to different age groups, Beverly and Daisy are always together alone in the class as the duo (and also the fact that they are shy too). Thus, since I didn't like to see small lonely groups/individuals, I decided to make an effort to talk to them. 

As time goes by, I decided to offer help on many modules, we exchange talks. Months later, Beverly, Daisy and I became bestfriends. Beverly and I were even closer bestfriends. This was the best friendshio in my life. Infact, many classmates looked at us and thought we were a couple. But of course we're not. I never thought of wanting to have a girlfriend. Don't like the thought of someone to suffer with my autistic mental illness and just don't like responsibilities. Anyways, I'm fat with a BMI of 34.5. I'm unattractive to her. 

To tell you how great the bestfriendship between Beverly and I was,
1: Beverly was the first friend to ever come to my house. I never liked ever having visitors to my house
2: We liked to poke each other.
3: We say a lot of random stuff, we sing in discord...
4: We allowed each other to lie on each other shoulder
5: We took pic together everytime the trio went out.
6: I became so willing to help her meet her course deadlines, even if it meant to burn the midnight oil.
7: Sending &lt;3 to each other many times, protraying that we loved each other as friends.
8: We even have secret instagram accounts dedicated to each other.
9: We video called in discord almost everyday, to sometimes even as late as 4am. Yes, we were insanely crazy. 

Fun fact: I was the first guy close friend to Beverly apparently. 

Everything about this friendship was so positive until...


[Main: Relationship Era 2019 Dec - 2021 Jan]
One day, she stopped. Beverly suddenly stopped doing the usual we do. I asked her whats wrong and I was shut from her. Unfortunately, till this day, I have no idea why our usual bestfriendship stopped completely. (When you read later on, I can confirm that it isn't because of the relationship with Cassie) 

About half a month to a month later, her relationship with Cassie started. In such a country that does not support LGBT, you can imagine how scary it is. Majority of the parents would also disapprove and might/will disown their children for being an LGBT or get scolded like hell. So it took her courage before she could tell me that her relationship existed (first and only one to know it that time. I had my suspicion she have a relationship, just not the LGBT) and that she couldn't do the things we used to do anymore so that Cassie won't get jealous, and that Beverly cannot focus a friendship and a relationship at the same time. I tried my best to understand, even though it hurts that the bestfriendship in my life is just gone... like that. I honestly didn't like that a relationship affected my bestfriendship with her. (See the 9 points I mention about how great my bestfriendhsip with Beverly was? All gone. There was no argument, there was no tension, nothing. Just all gone.) 

As their relationship went on, her friendship with Daisy and many other close friends (all girls) deteriorated. Her friends noticed that Beverly acted so different, and no longer chat as often as she usually be. 

On around 2019 Nov - Dec, her relationship with Cassie worsened, often having arguments that are irrelevant to this (TL:DR; I miss you, covid sucks, restriction sucks, can't meet up;etc), and that because of how this country society exist in treating LGBT, they think they can never be together. At this point, she shared to me her relationship issue and how she felt lonely, so I finally decided that I should help her regain her friendship with her close friends and Daisy back, in which I told her to just tell the truth, have just a nice talk. We teenagers/Young Adults surprisingly are okay with LGBT. In the end, simoly talking to her friends at the emotional midnight timing helped to recovered her friendships back to normal... except for me because ours was ended as bestfriendship before the relationship with Cassie occured. 

Anyways I always told her to continue her relationship, because I believed one day society will change since many of us young adults have been trying to petition to change some of the country laws towards LGBT. 

As per usual, this whole time, even though our bestfriendship stopped, I still continue to help her in studies with the midnight oil as much as I can, accompany her in games;etc. 

As the relationship got worse and Beverly kept telling me of how much she felt hurt, I told her she should really break up. She really sounded like she was abused and my heart really couldn't take it. Trust me, I didn't want her to break up because I knew she was so happy. She also didn't want to break up, but the mental toll got to her. 

[Main: Post-relationship Era Jan 2021 - Now]
The breakup happened. Cassie initiated the breakup with Beverly and was stern on not talking to each other ever again. Honestly, I respected their relationship because I saw how Cassie made Beverly really happy, so even though I was sad the bestfriendship is gone, I was happy that Beverly was really happy. But breakup? It really made me feel depressed, even though it sounded like it meant I can get my bestfriendship back, because I never seen Beverly this sad before. Initially I really wanted my bestfriendship back, but after I realise she needed time to heal, I decided to let it go and just waited for months. (Note: This meant that I'm partially responsible for making them break their relationship because I partially influenced Beverly's decision) 

Months later, at April, I know she still missed Cassie. I can't blame her. So, I decided to do the crazy. I talked to Beverly about how she felt, and all she wanted was answers from Cassie, on whether she was serious if the broke up was really because of disinterest.. and a couple of other questions. Beverly said that if she could get answers to her question, she would overcome and let go of the relationship. While in my heart, I feel pain, I also have a tiny sense of hope that our bestfriendship could return. So I did the crazy and talked to Cassie. Note: This is the first time I talked to Cassie; EVER. Cassie originally was somewhat reluctant to answer, but it took a month of helping Cassie in Cassie's course study that I managed to convince Cassie to try to answer all of Beverly's questions. 

On the day of graduation, Cassie answered only some of the questions, and the reply were mundane and felt like it didn't answer to Beverly's questions. So, Beverly said that I did enough and just tried to move on. At this point, its been 2 years since my bestfriendship was gone. I really missed it, and could never understand why Beverly didn't miss at all, likely to be overshadowed by her relationship. 

June, things got even worse. My friendship with Beverly worsened, and I was accused of stalking her, especially when I get so confused and curious as a person who sees her as a bestfriend still of why she kept offlining and onlining her status, and to determine if she is really offline by using other social media platform she shares her last seen/online status. One day, she told me to stop fucking stalking and blocked me on Telegram, and I told her that she went too far, kicked (not ban) her out of my super private discord server that only had me, her and someone else out of frustration and then she blocked me on all messaging applications, and unfollowed/blocked/unfriended all social media account except for 1. 

I was really hurt. Badly hurt that our friendship went from perfection to just.. I dunno. 

I got even more hurt when I realised her old self still existed when she talked to Daisy. She's just treating this way towards me. 

I prepared a birthday gift that is worth around $200.. the second birthday gift I ever prepared for anyone and somewhat most expensive gift, as also an apology that I didn't gift to her for 3 years despite us as bestfriends/friends (though to be fair she said my exustence was a gift last time hahahaha. She and Daisy gifted me once in 2020 too!). 

Unfrotnately, when I met her in real life to gift her the present early because she needed a parcel from me since she ordered something that delivers to my house, she rejected my gift. I was completely devasted. I begged her to accept my gift and she didn't. Furthermore, now she won't even respond to me. Her friendship that I helped her fixed was all fine.. just me. 

At this point, its already official that I lost my bestfriend who made me went out for depression for 2 years. I tried to gift but was even rejected. I was hoping she accepted the gift and then I can maybe finally move on a little, but nope. 

To me, she was everything. She made me so happy. It really hurts to see all these gone. Why must good things end? There wasn't any conflict, nothing bad happened and then things suddenly changed. 

I'm just so tired of life, tired of living. I'm just really tired. I really just want to suicide. I'm just so sick that all the time I spent in the relationship felt like it's gone. Maybe I am the asshole for being stalkish and questioning whh she goes fake offline. Maybe if she just wants me dead now. If I suicided, maybe she will be happier. Afterall, my this year birthday wish was about hoping she will be happy and remain happy in life. 

I don't deserve to live. Maybe I'm just evil. Anyways I'll have maybe a few days or less before I decide to suicide or not. I feel really alone now. I can't possibly share this to any friends. Anyways they will think its none of their business anyways... 

Fun fact: Beverly promised a hug pre relationship era, never gotten one unfortunately. Secretly just wanted the hug now to really feel much better about life. 

Please note: Even though I made it sound like Beverly is evil, rest assured that she used to support me, comfort me, accompanied me. She's really a kind hearted person but just shy and not so academically smart.
Do NOT attack anyone. I will feel more compelled to kill myself earlier if one of these members gets attacked. 

I do not want to talk to online people, I tend to despise them because most of them took my real life friends away. I know not all or not even many online people are like that. But I just felt I needed to share the pain before I really decide to die. 

[Ending]
You know, now that I think of it, maybe I didn't do enough for her... and that I'm just someone with a sick and shitty attitude 

Sigh, can't believe after all these... all the journeys we've been through, we're no longer friends... but no matter what, I still see you as my best friend, Beverly.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL:DR - I was born with with Autism and depression. Made a bestest friend in my life that made people think we are couples, lost the friend due to unknown reasons. 0.5-1 month later her relationship started. Friendship was even worse after their relationship have broken and now we&amp;#39;re not friends anymore. Got blocked, or unfollowed everywhere. My gift for her early birthday got rejected. Can&amp;#39;t get over, planned to die. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[If the situation is resolved, this post will be deleted. If I have fully commited to suicide, I will delete this post too. Also, throwaway account to prevent my close ones from getting affected.] &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sick of life, I&amp;#39;m sick of being nice. I can&amp;#39;t bring myself to do something bad or revengeful, so I guess I&amp;#39;ll just suicide. Friends find solving my situation a burdern. I lost what feels everything to me. I can&amp;#39;t wait to suicide on my best friend (as I still do see her as) birthday (which maybe maybe happens to be tomorrow. I don&amp;#39;t know if I would have decided by then.). I&amp;#39;m ready to be cancelled by the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I&amp;#39;m considered somewhat successful, in a fortunate country, in a higher than average income family. Unable to appreciate what I have, first world problems, am I right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Some irrelevant stuff]
I&amp;#39;m a selfish prick, I hate my family, I don&amp;#39;t care about them. I get it, they raised me, I apologise I can&amp;#39;t appreciate things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Background]
I was born with Autism and I have depression, and was depressed for about my whole life. Even though happy things occured, I for some reason can&amp;#39;t be not depressed. I only overcame depression temporarily because of my bestfriendship with Beverly (whom will be introduced later). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Pre-story]
I&amp;#39;ll just share a stereotypical bestfriendship to feeling suicidal story. Just note that I have attempted suicide 3 times before 3 years ago (before 2018) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 2 main people in this broken fairytale. Me and the fake name I shall call Beverly. Maybe at times in this post I&amp;#39;ll call her B or something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main - Myself [M] &amp;amp; Beverly [F]
Side - Daisy [Beverly (also) best friend,] [F], Cassie (Beverly ex-girlfriend, LGBT) [F] &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Main: Pre-relationship Era, 2018 May - 2019 Dec]
Beverly and I started to talk through some scholarship interview. These made us friends, and we became great friends after a few exchanges. I also made friends with Daisy, introduced through Beverly. Since my class only have 6 girls which consist 2 Malay and 4 Chinese and that the malays are 1 group and the chinese are split to 2 groups due to different age groups, Beverly and Daisy are always together alone in the class as the duo (and also the fact that they are shy too). Thus, since I didn&amp;#39;t like to see small lonely groups/individuals, I decided to make an effort to talk to them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As time goes by, I decided to offer help on many modules, we exchange talks. Months later, Beverly, Daisy and I became bestfriends. Beverly and I were even closer bestfriends.

I'm 21 years of age, I'm from Germany and am a male.
I have been depressed for many years, never rlly had a reason.
2 years ago, when I was about to go into 12th grade I was super stressed about school.
We went to Malta in a small group to learn diving and got a license, I never felt better in life.
I was surrounded by people I didn't know, but everyone was instantly like family, I didn't have anything to worry about, I felt free, like I could do everything I wanted, I stood on my own feet, wevwent diving every day for the week we were there.

I never had any friends.
In kindergarden I only had my cousin, he moved before I went to school, I barely stayed in contact with him.
I was never the fastest in school, the teachers were the first to give up on me.
Second grade I had my first real friend, our moms knew each other since our birth, I was a few months older then him, he was a quiet kid, he also didn't have any other friends, and that didn't change for the next few years for both of us.
Third grade was he'll for us, the new teacher didn't like us, you could just tell, learned later that the teacher wasn't good anyway, she got fired a bit after we graduated 4th grade. A bit into third grade our parents heard about a private school that's getting build from the ground up with a promising concept, that's when we changed to that school, we helped build it, it was lead by parents who tried teaching us we did actually have one teacher she was great, she rlly believed in us.
She got fired a few weeks in because she didn't wanna stick to the concept. We left that school not long after and went back to third grade in out old school, but with a little twist, we did not get put in the same class again, we were separated and I was put in a completely different class where I knew noone.
I redid the third grade and went on to school grades 5-10. Again, my awful teacher managed to put me in new class again, this time, with all the students you don't wanna be enemies with.

The years went by and I managed to keep my head out of drugs alcohol and other crap, I made friends in the class over, I still am friends with those two.

Quick explanations,
You are bad in school and only do 9 years = secondary school diploma

You are average and do 10 years = secondary school leaving certificate

You are good and do 10 years but with a good grade point avarage = extended secondary school leaving certificate.

I managed to actually get the extended secondary and went on to High school.

While all that was happening, at some point my mom had a kidney failure and is on dialysis, that was about 8 years ago I think, and her condition was getting worse each year to the point where she can barely walk up the stairs anymore. My dad has a full-time job as a chef and comes home late, and when he's home, he is infront of his computer.

I never rlly felt that much love from my family, sure they love me and all, but everything else is more important.

Anyway, I'm in high school and the stress is picking up, I manage it a bit but my grades decline, queue the trip to Malta, I'm feeling freed, never felt better, I come back home, suddenly, straight F's, I can't remember anything anymore, simple equation just gone, I feel overwhelmed, I have existential questions, what do I do, what can I even do with my life now? I contemplate suicide, again... this time not just because I'm sad. One day in school, a exam again, straight F. I tell the teacher I'm not to well, um going home, I'm on the bus, burst into tears, I arrive home and walk the longest mile to our house I have ever walked, I open the door, walk up the stairs, not making a sound, my mother laying in the kitchen on the bench, exhausted, I walk up to her, she sits upright, looks me in the eyes and gives me a hug, I can't stop crying for what felt like 10 minutes, I tell her I thought about killing myself, I need help. That's when we contacted the psychiatrist or therapist or whatever.
All went well and I got better, had a drawback when my uncle died, which rlly impacted our family and still does to this day, a year later, he lived next door and now we got to pay that house too, and because germany is a hell of paperwork, a year later we still have lots of problems with it.

I turn 21 in a few days and last month I left therapy, we thought everything was fine again, I'm going back to school, a different way this time, something that fits me better and is not as much in school and more job related, but since even before I left therapy I felt empty, I wasn't okay, I wanted to be. but I wasn't.

So here we are now, I have not a reason to be sad, have not a reason for depression, nothing in my way but still, I want to take my live, I have never thought bad about it, in my had I go through many ways I could end it, many ways I could have killed X person in Y ways, I could have saved the school from a shooting, I could have shot up the school.

I harmed myself, but I didn't feel anything, it didn't help me, I stopped doing it shortly after.

I'm filled with joy and happiness someday, and I'm empty most days.
I like getting hugged
but I never get hugged
I like telling jokes
but I have no one that listens
I like writing poetry
but I scrap it every time (actually did that here too, this whole thing was poetic once) 
Kaffeemaschine (yes, autocorrect gets it) 

I just want a normal life, I don't want to worry about suddenly having the urge to kill myself. I don't want to feel emotions that don't have a reason to be, I feel guilty for things I haven't done, I feel sad about things that never happened. 
I miss people I never knew, I crave loneliness but hate being alone. 

I have tried to get help, they helped me.
But I still feel the way I do.
I never tried suicide because I habe people that care. and I did care about them, but I'm loosing my grip on all of it, sure I now know the reason to keep living, I know that people love me, I know I have chances and can do whatever I like.

but. I don't want to.

I don't want enter the doors that open, when others close. I stopped caring about people.

I don't deserve to end it
I don't want to end it

but I also don't want it to keep going.
Everyone around me things that this bit of therapy changed me, and so did I. But it only removed the big stones that path my way, the holes are still there, and I fall down the holes constantly.
Im now just waiting for the perfect moment where I snap and nothing makes sence anymore, because I can't do it now, my purpose is only to survive each day on its own until the point comes where I can't.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t get what&amp;#39;s wrong with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 21 years of age, I&amp;#39;m from Germany and am a male.
I have been depressed for many years, never rlly had a reason.
2 years ago, when I was about to go into 12th grade I was super stressed about school.
We went to Malta in a small group to learn diving and got a license, I never felt better in life.
I was surrounded by people I didn&amp;#39;t know, but everyone was instantly like family, I didn&amp;#39;t have anything to worry about, I felt free, like I could do everything I wanted, I stood on my own feet, wevwent diving every day for the week we were there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never had any friends.
In kindergarden I only had my cousin, he moved before I went to school, I barely stayed in contact with him.
I was never the fastest in school, the teachers were the first to give up on me.
Second grade I had my first real friend, our moms knew each other since our birth, I was a few months older then him, he was a quiet kid, he also didn&amp;#39;t have any other friends, and that didn&amp;#39;t change for the next few years for both of us.
Third grade was he&amp;#39;ll for us, the new teacher didn&amp;#39;t like us, you could just tell, learned later that the teacher wasn&amp;#39;t good anyway, she got fired a bit after we graduated 4th grade. A bit into third grade our parents heard about a private school that&amp;#39;s getting build from the ground up with a promising concept, that&amp;#39;s when we changed to that school, we helped build it, it was lead by parents who tried teaching us we did actually have one teacher she was great, she rlly believed in us.
She got fired a few weeks in because she didn&amp;#39;t wanna stick to the concept. We left that school not long after and went back to third grade in out old school, but with a little twist, we did not get put in the same class again, we were separated and I was put in a completely different class where I knew noone.
I redid the third grade and went on to school grades 5-10. Again, my awful teacher managed to put me in new class again, this time, with all the students you don&amp;#39;t wanna be enemies with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The years went by and I managed to keep my head out of drugs alcohol and other crap, I made friends in the class over, I still am friends with those two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick explanations,
You are bad in school and only do 9 years = secondary school diploma&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are average and do 10 years = secondary school leaving certificate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are good and do 10 years but with a good grade point avarage = extended secondary school leaving certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to actually get the extended secondary and went on to High school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all that was happening, at some point my mom had a kidney failure and is on dialysis, that was about 8 years ago I think, and her condition was getting worse each year to the point where she can barely walk up the stairs anymore. My dad has a full-time job as a chef and comes home late, and when he&amp;#39;s home, he is infront of his computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never rlly felt that much love from my family, sure they love me and all, but everything else is more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;#39;m in high school and the stress is picking up, I manage it a bit but my grades decline, queue the trip to Malta, I&amp;#39;m feeling freed, never felt better, I come back home, suddenly, straight F&amp;#39;s, I can&amp;#39;t remember anything anymore, simple equation just gone, I feel overwhelmed, I have existential questions, what do I do, what can I even do with my life now? I contemplate suicide, again... this time not just because I&amp;#39;m sad. One day in school, a exam again, straight F. I tell the teacher I&amp;#39;m not to well, um going home, I&amp;#39;m on the bus, burst into tears, I arrive home and walk the longest mile to our house I have ever walked, I open the door, walk up the stairs, not making a sound, my mother laying in the kitchen on the bench, exhausted, I walk up to her, she sits upright, looks me in the eyes and gives me a hug, I can&amp;#39;t stop crying for what felt like 10 minutes, I tell her I thought about killing myself, I need help. That&amp;#39;s when we contacted the psychiatrist or therapist or whatever.
All went well and I got better, had a drawback when my uncle died, which rlly impacted our family and still does to this day, a year later, he lived next door and now we got to pay that house too, and because germany is a hell of paperwork, a year later we still have lots of problems with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turn 21 in a few days and last month I left therapy, we thought everything was fine again, I&amp;#39;m going back to school, a different way this time, something that fits me better and is not as much in school and more job related, but since even before I left therapy I felt empty, I wasn&amp;#39;t okay, I wanted to be. but I wasn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here we are now, I have not a reason to be sad, have not a reason for depression, nothing in my way but still, I want to take my live, I have never thought bad about it, in my had I go through many ways I could end it, many ways I could have killed X person in Y ways, I could have saved the school from a shooting, I could have shot up the school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I harmed myself, but I didn&amp;#39;t feel anything, it didn&amp;#39;t help me, I stopped doing it shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m filled with joy and happiness someday, and I&amp;#39;m empty most days.
I like getting hugged
but I never get hugged
I like telling jokes
but I have no one that listens
I like writing poetry
but I scrap it every time (actually did that here too, this whole thing was poetic once) 
Kaffeemaschine (yes, autocorrect gets it) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want a normal life, I don&amp;#39;t want to worry about suddenly having the urge to kill myself. I don&amp;#39;t want to feel emotions that don&amp;#39;t have a reason to be, I feel guilty for things I haven&amp;#39;t done, I feel sad about things that never happened. 
I miss people I never knew, I crave loneliness but hate being alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried to get help, they helped me.
But I still feel the way I do.
I never tried suicide because I habe people that care. and I did care about them, but I&amp;#39;m loosing my grip on all of it, sure I now know the reason to keep living, I know that people love me, I know I have chances and can do whatever I like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but. I don&amp;#39;t want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want enter the doors that open, when others close. I stopped caring about people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t deserve to end it
I don&amp;#39;t want to end it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but I also don&amp;#39;t want it to keep going.

My friends don&amp;#39;t care about me, my family has been indoctrinated into a cult, the family I could trust have either died or disappeared, I&amp;#39;m a college dropout working a dead end job, and the love of my life is now with someone else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mojo&amp;#39;s the only one I have left to live for. He&amp;#39;s 17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he dies, I die with him.&lt;/p&gt;

I rarely ever tell them anything anymore because they're so invalidating and uncaring. 

I'm trying to find reasons to hold on, even the little things but they're just becoming less and less. 

I've been thinking this week about if I could see into my future and see how things turned out, would I? At this point, I think I would and if it didn't work out (according to the rules of all of that ofc) I think I'd just end it. 

I've been struggling with so many mental and physical health problems since I was younger and things are only getting worse. 

Every morning, the second I wake up, I am flooded with pain and war in my head. I dread having woken up and count the hours 'til I can go to sleep and then I delay going to sleep because every night I have so many nightmares and wake up so much that even at night I can't find any moment of peace. It's an endless cycle of hell.

I can't walk around my house without having my earphones in and music up loud because that can lessen the volume of everything going on in my head. 

I am a disappointment. I am the elephant in the room. I can't get a job because of my health. 

The thought of living another day makes me feel sick and breakdown. 

Part of me just wants to end it. I've been cutting. But part of me also just wants my family to notice and actually care and help me. 

If I just kms then they wouldn't have that financial burden, they wouldn't be so annoyed or stressed, they could all just get on with their lives, they'd be so much happier. 

I think what's really keeping me going is my cat and the tiny thought of what if it does all work out? what if I have, do, everything I want and become who I want to be in an ideal/dream life. 

It's nice to have your head in the clouds for a bit, if not that then underground sounds better than the surface.

I was always in a desperate and frantic state of mind when I made the posts. I don't know if I ever had the intention of acting but because of that I know I have to now. I'm going to spend time with my family, I always neglected them and even though I don't really want to hangout with them I know its the right thing to do. 

My mind is a hell and I am a terrible person. Maybe I'm only saying these things to gain sympathy or justify the wrong things I've done in my life. Maybe I do have OCD and i'm just being harsh on myself... I don't know anything about myself anymore. I am sure I am a monster and I don't want to walk this earth anymore. I feel like the phrase ""hurt people, hurt people"" really applies to me. Alot of people think I am sweet and caring, but maybe I'm just very manipulative. Because when someone doesn't return the favors I do, I bottle up anger and resentment. At least I think I do know, Its hard to remember who I was even six months ago. I look at everything in a new light now. People offer me help like work books and therapy, but I just wanna die... I don't wanna do all that work. I don't think I can be saved. I'm lazy and irresponsible. I've been like this my whole life. On top of that I'm a pathological liar... and I'm stupid. I can never figure things out on my own.

I did this thing when I was a kid, whenever I got in trouble I would have severe mental break downs. One time I remember I sat on the stairs saying ""I know my mom doesn't love me""... what kind of monster says that about their own mom? Especially a single mom that was trying their best to take care of me?

About 6 months ago is when all of this started, I met a girl online. We're in a ""relationship"" but I swear I look at people as objects. All I do is constantly tell this girl I love her and plan a future with her and I just never treat her like another normal human being. It's like I want to control how she feels, I want her to give everything to me just so I can feel secure in the relationship. On top of that I feel like I wear a mask, she doesn't even really know me. Shit, I don't even know me anymore.

But, I've really felt alone all my life. It's like I want close relationships but at the same time I don't because shit like this happens when people get too close. I can't tell if I'm evil or if I'm just self sabotaging my entire life. I'm worried I'm a sociopathic, narccisistic, asshole. 

I would rather die now than have my family see the true evil person I really am deep down. I'm ashamed of myself, although my family isn't very emotional or close they really do care about my well being. Some people don't even have that and I'm still where I am. Goes to show I'm truly just selfish. 

Also, I think terrible things that really make me question who I am. I once thought about rather having this girl I ""love"" die than be without her. What kind of thought is that???????? Shit, like that pops in my head and I just know I need to end myself before I hurt people in this world. I'm angry at the world, probably because It's too beautiful for someone like me to be in it.

It's as if I'm not human, not one of them. Family means absolutely nothing to me. I crave love and security, yet aren't willing to truly care about someone.

It's not like I can either. I just feel like nobody truly cares about me and if they do - I don't care. I feel so distant from everyone, my body aching from the loneliness that has turned into physical pain.

I feel so unimportant, so useless, so weird, so unintelligent.

I was always a weird kid. Can't tell if it's trauma or I was born defective.

After that my mum was addicted to drugs so she could barely take care of me. I have a disabled brother so he’s basically the focus of everything I never get any attention from my mum.

I don’t know how I’m supposed to get anywhere with life I haven’t been to school since 14 too, my mum stopped me from going around the time I started having suicidal thoughts I guess that was the ignition of it. Now all she does is lay down all day and do nothing sometimes I have to go days without eating. I’m just so sick of this, everyone i tell never takes me seriously. I wish someone would help me I feel so hopeless and lost at this point it feels like suicide is the only option.

I just feel like my whole life is worthless and hopeless, I had a pretty shitty childhood my mum didn’t really care what I did and my dad died when I was 9. After that my mum was addicted to drugs so she could barely take care of me. I have a disabled brother so he’s basically the focus of everything I never get any attention from my mum. I don’t remember the last time she said she loves me or hugged her, I just wish I had someone who actually loved me. I’ve lost all of my friends because apparently I’m a dick but I don’t know how suppose I just try to push everyone away. I don’t know how I’m supposed to get anywhere with life I haven’t been to school since 14 too, my mum stopped me from going around the time I started having suicidal thoughts I guess that was the ignition of it. Now all she does is lay down all day and do nothing sometimes I have to go days without eating. I’m just so sick of this, everyone i tell never takes me seriously. I wish someone would help me I feel so hopeless and lost at this point it feels like suicide is the only option.

I've had problems my whole life. Things I've gone through, resulting in me developing some strange behaviour. I recently decided to go to therapy, I've been struggling with ""sad thoughts"", social anxiety and paranoia that have only gotten worse. The problem is that I then understood a lot more about myself. I only went once, the therapist then had to go on a 4 weeks vacation. I now know I struggle with derealization and depersonalization. This made my paranoia almost completely disappear. Those feelings have only gotten worse though. I don't even remember how long ago the meeting was, maybe a week or two? Since then I now question absolutely everything. I've always thought of myself ""as a character"". Like my life is a show. I can't find any actual meaning behind life, but I've never needed it. All life needed was the one experiencing it being immersed in their own life. I think I lost this since my therapy-session though. I had plans on streaming for example, along other ambitions or interests I've wanted to work on for a long time. I've dropped all plans on anything now though, and stopped caring about what other people, including my family, think of me. I go up and eat breakfast at 4:30 pm. My relationship with my gf feels so strange to me now. I still love her, I think. I don't know anymore though. How would I know? I don't think it's supposed to feel like this. I hate the thought of being around her, but I want to give her the whole world. I would sacrifice anything for her, but could I choose I would shut myself in and not meet with anyone. And even just writing this makes me second-guess myself though. I can't say that I actually feel this. But it feels so much, so real. It feels like it can't be though, I am complaining for nothing.   
I'm also sorry if this is a mess, I'm writing this while my mind is on fire. I don't know if I would do something drastic. I don't feel suicidal, but I can't actually find any reasons I had in the past for not doing something terrible. I don't want to. I really don't want to. But I could. I could spend 40 years behind a desk and always be so shut down about everything I enjoy as I am today. I'm so young, I should be excited about what the future holds. But I can't see myself in a future I like. I want to be where I am forever. Time just feels to slip out of my hands. And it's always felt like that, but before I could justify myself with how I atleast have enjoyed myself or done everything I could. Now I can't say the same anymore. What if ""not wasting my time"" would be doing something horrible? What says that that isn't the case? If nothing actually matters, what reason should ""getting better"" be the target? Can I? I never have. My life's been hard, but I've been positive the whole time. I know think that's because I just second-questioned myself. And still I know feel so much worse than I always have. So I can't find a way out. My gf always tells me that ""it *will* get better"", but that doesn't have to be true! Not everyone gets better. There are those who lose their minds. Who's to say that won't be me?   
So I'm scared. I can't talk to anyone about this. I can't even talk about all this with the therapist when she comes back either. It'll be the same old as always, I sit and smile and say what I think I should say. What makes me the most interesting as a character. I would be more interesting if I had struggles, right? Maybe that is why I have such an obsession with being sad. What if that goes further? What if I get violent, towards myself or anyone else I know?   
If I wanna go there, I've even had conversations with people that aren't there. I've heard this is normal, my brother have done the same for example. But that's the only other person I've heard about this, and it sounds an awful lot like other conditions I've heard about, like schizophrenia. That would be genetic. So it wouldn't be too far off.   
And I also change whatever I think all the time! I can feel like this one minute, than think I was being stupid or even ridiculous after. I live a normal life, nothing seems off. I don't fight anymore, everything would be fine from an outside watcher. I should be fine. I know I'll hate this post tomorrow. And I know noone will read this. It's a fucking mess.

I'm losing everything, first depressive episode I lost my passion for maths and physics as I developped my first anhedonia this made me depressed for years and forced me into a college I hated so much for job security and were very depressed and suicidal for a long time until I met the love of my life then my second depressive episode hit and I lost all my romantic feelings became numb af unable to feel any love for her unable to feel anything at all this numbness also caused me to social withdraw and I cut contact with all my friends and this second depressive episode caused me to drop out of college now I dont know what to do. 

My passion and my love were the only things that mattered to me in this world and I lost them. Theres nothing left for me anymore theres nothing to fight for anymore I lost everything that mattered to me.

I cant keep on living like this known after each depressive episode Im gonna lose the most precious thing to me this is a hard life some of you may be able to endure it but for me I just cant.

I have plenty of hobbies and friends to distract myself from depression and I know how to push myself to be a better person. There are plenty to moments I can look back on and be proud of myself and I’m certain the future holds a lot in store for me good or bad. But over the last few years I have waken up to the reality that is the world. Fraud is around every corner, people are being taken advantage of to the tenth degree, our planet is actively dying before our eyes, the people today don’t make life worth living, I’m more then likely going to spend the rest of my life working a job I hate with little benefit to myself scraping away whatever amount of joy I can get while facing diminishing return after diminishing. I can’t keep living in this world that is clearly corrupted by the exponentially cancerous human race. I’ve lived with suicidal thoughts my entire life and after years and years of enduring life I don’t feel any better or worse, it’s just the same amount of me wanting kill myself with critical thinking entangled in it.

What I want to know is does anyone have answer for me that will make life worth living and it won’t subside the problems of this world, or do I just have the option of dealing with the punishment that is life or not.

I know how to make my life happy and feel accomplished, but everywhere I go I see and feel pain and misery and I’m just thinking what is the point the planet is going to die we are in a sinking ship and why should I stick around to check it out when I know I will hate the result.

I have plenty of hobbies and friends to distract myself from depression and I know how to push myself to be a better person. There are plenty to moments I can look back on and be proud of myself and I’m certain the future holds a lot in store for me good or bad. But over the last few years I have waken up to the reality that is the world. Fraud is around every corner, people are being taken advantage of to the tenth degree, our planet is actively dying before our eyes, the people today don’t make life worth living, I’m more then likely going to spend the rest of my life working a job I hate with little benefit to myself scraping away whatever amount of joy I can get while facing diminishing return after diminishing. I can’t keep living in this world that is clearly corrupted by the exponentially cancerous human race. I’ve lived with suicidal thoughts my entire life and after years and years of enduring life I don’t feel any better or worse, it’s just the same amount of me wanting kill myself with critical thinking entangled in it.&lt;/p&gt;

How do you inform them so they don’t make the same mistakes that you did? When did you choose to tell them and if you chose not to, why so?

I've dreamed about ending my life. I've stood on a ledge and thought for a few minutes how easy it'd be to just jump. I've thought about standing in front of a train. Jumping in front of cars on a highway. Crashing in to cars with my moped. Jumping from my fifth floor balcony. And even the old classics like hanging yourself or using any weapon. I even thought of travelling from Europe to the US to jump off a skyskraper or maybe the Golden Gate Bridge.

&amp;#x200B;

For the last ten months I've also been committed to different psych wards. The first two months (since august 2020) I stayed in two closed facilities. The first they drugged me up so much that I was high on benzos for three weeks straight. Then they transferred me to a ward for junkies and addicts. Because I was so drugged up I wasn't even coherent. There they tried to label me with three different diagnosis. I also received the second punch to my face ever during my stay there. Some guy in his psychosis didn't like the way I was looking at him while he was tripping.

&amp;#x200B;

Then my life became a tad easier. They transferred me to a semi-open facility with people of my own age after 6 weeks. With the goal to stay there for a few more weeks and then move back home with my mom. But that's where my trouble really became serious. Because this was the second time in three years that I'd been committed my mom didn't want me back home. She did everything in her power to make sure I was unable to move back in with her and my younger sibblings.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story, lots of depression and suicide ideation later. I'm finally back home. I did everything I could to beat my mom, force her to take me back, and made sure I wasn't homeless overnight. But I also had to be patient for ten months because I know she wouldn't have taken me back even something like five weeks ago. There's a lot of tension at home and she makes it very clear that she doesn't like my pressence and the way I choose to live my life.

&amp;#x200B;

And partly I can understand where she's coming from. We've always clashed in certain ways. I'm her first child. My father has been absent for the past 20 years. I started doing drugs pretty late in my teens. I'm just the product of bad parenting, absence of love in my household and too much freedom. I've also been pretty naive before my twenties and people have abused that. Like, a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

Even now I still face bullying from time to time and people who remember who I was in the past (long story, different vibe). But I'm almost 24 and I just wanna move past my history with some people. And in many ways /i've already done so mentally. But in practice I still gotta grow a lot before I'll be satisfied with the person I'm becoming.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanna know. Does it actually stay better? Can it really be over, the constant urge to stop existing. Can I really accept the person I became and strive to achieve more than constant sadness and being overwhelmed by life. That's like the only thing I'm worried about. That the darkness I had inside never really went away.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So for the better part of two years I&amp;#39;ve been contemplating suicide.

Said that you love me, but that'll last for never

It’s 5pm. I’m still lying in bed in a dark room because I’m scared that I’ll do something if I let myself move. I can’t sleep because the most emotionally damaging kind of thing for me has occurred, and all I do is have panic attacks and spiral. I can’t eat because I won’t keep it down. I can’t shower because I’m so tempted to just bleed out in it.


No one is keeping me here. People can say they care, but it doesn’t matter to me. I’m nothing special to anyone, and it will be a pain they can get over without a doubt.

I know I can have a bright future, but does it matter if it’s filled with constant severe emotional pain?


I want to go to the emergency room because maybe I could be helped, but I don’t know if it’s worth it.

I’m not sure if I have it in me, and I don’t want to try in case it puts me in an even worse place.

This is a dumb post but I want to die so hopefully that's good enough.

I was rewatching some of Jenna Marbles old videos when I came across the video of her taking her dogs (Bunny and Kermit specifically) to the beach with Julien.

As I was watching Jenna walk her two dogs along the beach and watching her and Julien sit in their wind tent and eat sandwiches, I'd never felt such a huge disconnection from myself and another person before.

I just, cannot ever picture myself in a position where I'm with another person that I love and just... Being completely content like that.

They just seemed so happy to simply be in each other's company with their dogs.

Fuck nothing like that will ever happen to me.

Yet I hate it, I refuse to wear it as a badge of honour. I don’t want a difficult life, I rather have an easy one. This year I have tried to let things go and start fresh. Some days I feel okay and “empowered”. Other days, like today, I can’t take it. The past and my current situation make me feel so small and powerless. 

I am so addicted to inactivity. I went from an abused and bright child to being a brainless lazy piece of shit. All I do all day besides cleaning my room and cooking, is browsing Reddit and watching YouTube videos. I rarely comment, I just consume content. It took me months to change and now I’m back to the same behaviour. The sad thing is that I studied disorders and know what’s affecting me. Therefore, the two psychologists see me as someone who can cope with it. In the sessions, I feel like I don’t have it that bad so I just accept the advice they give me and try to implement it. Yet, after a week at most I get back to that place of hating myself again. 

I know how to find ways to torture myself without it going too far. I pluck body hair, but make sure not to touch any areas on my face or head. I binge on food, but make sure not to purge and do some fasts instead. Yet, my thoughts are so depressing and ugly it feels like there are invisible knives in it. I have come at a point that I think maybe I should cut myself, maybe I should get into debt, maybe I should become an alcoholic, maybe I should start using drugs. Only then will they take me serious. I even told the psychologist I was thinking of killing myself and she asked if I had taken steps towards it. I said I had not, but have a strong urge to jump off a bridge or jump in front of the train…. And I seem normal enough when talking and not crying so maybe she doesn’t see it as urgent. It’s really frustrating me. 

The reason why I talk normally is, because of the pandemic I have digital sessions. And I have roommates who seem to already judge me for not working, so I don’t want them to hear me crying. I also can’t talk freely at home. I wish I could live by myself, but I don’t have the funds for it. And I can’t get myself to apply for a job, and the few times I did I got rejected…

One of my parents left the whole continent, and the other one I only have contact with since a few months. My mom accused my dad of being a pedophile so I’m wary of being in contact with him. My mom left to a wartorn country, so I can’t visit her even. Both of them are not there for me and hurt me a lot in the past. I tried to forgive them, but they always disappoint me. When I call they don’t pick up the call, and when they rarely call me is because they need something. 

I can’t even be with my long distance boyfriend, because I don’t work and can’t help him with visa. And he’s busy finishing his thesis and we have 12 hours distance between us. He supports me so much emotionally. Instead of supporting him back I lash out at him and pressure him to look for a job in my country. Today, I kept arguing to him and hurt him again with my words. 

To be honest, I just want to give up. This summer I want to visit Disneyland for the first time in my life and after just end it all. The only thing that brought me happiness as a kid besides food, and videogames was Disney movies. Now food became a crutch and I don’t remember the last time I enjoyed playing a game. Hopefully I can have my last happy day before I die.

I understand if you think this is a foolish reason to commit suicide but thats the only escape method that I found, and to be honest my life hasn't been the best so yeah kinda finish it with a blast.

I'm still chosing a suicide method but sounds like gas explosion would be the ""painless"" option, cars don't CO2 poison you and I don't have access to guns, so gas shall be.

I'm writing this as a reminder, for anyone to read that I at least existed, or for me if I don't kill myself tomorrow, that this was the worst phase of my life and in the future I will read this and find it cringe and such 

Is kinda funny expressing this issues on Reddit but his fucking pain won't leave me, if there is some painkiller for this would be a dream, but I guess living drugged in anti depressents is not a good idea either

Edit: im not the person with the worst past but I got raped and drugged when I was 15 with my cousin, i don't think this helps a lot, in this possible suicide of mine, since this memory is kinda blocked in my mind, but at any case it feel good to say this to anyone, kinda at ease

That kinda scares me, I'm calm about dying, that should not be right I suppose, weren't supposed my survival instincts to kick in or whatever this feels way to ""natural"", like this will be just one more random explosion case and whatever, doesn't feel special at any sense, i feel like just one more body to be burn, dam I'm talking to much, any questions feel free to ask, tomorrow around 6pm est is my suicide try so yeah goodbye I guess","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have taken money from a lot of friends and such, but now that I lost everything I cannot even look to they&amp;#39;re faces, just the thought of telling them that I fucked up is hard enough, I&amp;#39;m just 18, being pretty pussy for thinking about suicide due to somethings as stupid as pride, but I can&amp;#39;t live with this felling in my hearth, i don&amp;#39;t know how to explain, but I can&amp;#39;t even sleep is like a pressure in my chest, my girlfriend helps all a lot this coldness fix quite a bit with her, but it keeps growing, and the debts that I own they will just keep growing as well, one of the friends that help me get some money had to order a loan to help me, I feel like I betrayed him, not just him, everybody, i just want this pain in my chest to stop, i don&amp;#39;t know what exactly is but is cold and it doesn&amp;#39;t let me even sleep or eat, has been 2 days since I got scammed, and still the pressure doesn&amp;#39;t flitch it just grows, suicide would be painful, I&amp;#39;m a selfish fucker, i do think dying would make some people sad but whatever, if I feel sad, i will be dead anyways, since, well I will just disappear when I die what pain would I cause would mean nothing to me, after all the dead doesn&amp;#39;t have emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand if you think this is a foolish reason to commit suicide but thats the only escape method that I found, and to be honest my life hasn&amp;#39;t been the best so yeah kinda finish it with a blast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still chosing a suicide method but sounds like gas explosion would be the &amp;quot;painless&amp;quot; option, cars don&amp;#39;t CO2 poison you and I don&amp;#39;t have access to guns, so gas shall be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m writing this as a reminder, for anyone to read that I at least existed, or for me if I don&amp;#39;t kill myself tomorrow, that this was the worst phase of my life and in the future I will read this and find it cringe and such &lt;/p&gt;

I feel like everything around me is falling apart. Some of it is my fault, and some of it is something that I cannot control. I will be listing what I think the causes are. I am sorry if my construction of this post is hard to read; I am not very good with english.

I have a chronic illness that makes my everyday life hard. Everything that I love doing or anything that I want to improve on is near impossible to achieve because my illness. I work hard when I want something, but it's really frustrating that my illness keeps holding me back. I go through a lot of pain and treatment is very hard and expensive. Everytime I have a relapse, I have to go onto a liquid diet for three months. Same drink everyday. Same taste in my mouth for three months. There are some easier treatments, but I cannot afford it. 

My relationship with my family is not that great. Ever since I was a child my parents would always fight almost every month. The fights lasted days or a week. Due to that I have been always anxious when I hear a loud sound or people screaming, even when I am out of the house. My heart would start beating fast and eventually my hands would not stop shaking. They split up when I was sixteen and had divorce a 3 years late, which was last year.  Even though my parents provided me food, shelter, money, and healthcare, I feel no affection for them. My father rarely talks to me and my mother mostly thinks about her work. I tried to open up with many times, but they seem to care very little and does nothing to improve my views of them or my relationship to them.

My grandma, who I love very much, died last year due to covid. She lives in another country and rarely had the chance to visit her. We video call every other day to keep in touch with each other. Unfortunately, due to her old age and some other complications her body can't keep up with the treatment. It really sucks that I wasn't able to attend her funeral and talk to her when she got admitted to the hospital. 

I also lost my best friend to an accident last January. We've known each other since elementary school. We went to the same highschool and university. We even chose the same course to study. It happened so fast.

I became anxious talking to people that eventually I shut myself from my other friends and rarely talk to them. I do not know the reason why I get anxious now. Last year I can still talk to people normally.

It feels unreal that these things happen to me one after the other. I do not know what to deal with first and how to cope with it. I think of commiting suicide everyday. Fortunately, my s/o keeps from doing it. Just thinking how it would affect her someone she loves commit suicide breaks my heart.

It goes beyond 9 years as I’ve always dealt with terrible thoughts as a child. When I was 15 and my mothers was being abusive I snapped and decided to end my life. I ran away, called my mom on a pay phone, said my last words and then headed to the railway tracks. I was inches away from it being over, but I decided that I’d stay and try to make a difference with my life. 

I have never felt loved in my life. The people who said they loved me are the same ones that would hit me, make me feel horrible with words and neglect me. It’s not like I’ve never had the opportunity to have a relationship, I’ve actually had several. It feels as though getting into one knowing I will take my own life one day would be inconsiderate to the partner so I’ve turned those people away each time. Every day I feel this unbelievable pain inside of me, this part of me that just wants to have that feeling of falling knowing that someone is there to catch you. The safety of being yourself and knowing you will be loved. This feeling shakes me at my very core and I need to think “you will never be loved and that’s okay” just to survive. 

Here I am 9 years later having tried weekly therapy for 6 of those. Playing medication roulette and learning techniques like grounding that can apparently undo years of suffering. Nothing has worked. I’m even on a wait list for Electroconvulsive therapy. My mental health diagnoses can’t be counted on 2 hands. 

And yet I do feel some freedom. I’m progressing more without therapy accepting my own death than I am trying to fight it. I’m finally on track to my goal of getting a PhD and hopefully making some contribution to making the world better. I had a 4.0 GPA last semester and it has been getting easier. It’s a goal I am hell bent on so I can finally earn my death and be free from this pain. I find a certain solace in being unsavable and every time I’m successful I feel validated in my own decision. I feel like pushing through all this pain and making a difference, even if that means only publishing a couple molecular biology papers, gives me the right to take my life. This is the vehicle I’ve chosen to try to make the world better and it’s the vehicle that will let me feel the peace of closing my eyes and knowing that I never need to open them again.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every day for the last 9 years I felt like I’ve woken up not knowing if today was the day I’d finally end my pain.
