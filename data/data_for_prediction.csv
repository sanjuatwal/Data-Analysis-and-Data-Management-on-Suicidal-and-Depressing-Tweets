"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",SQLwitch,175,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/,understand people reply immediately op invitation talk privately mean help type response usually lead either disappointment disaster usually work quite differently say pm anytime casual social context huge admiration appreciation goodwill good citizenship many support others flag inappropriate content even know many struggling hard work behind scene information resource make easier give get quality help small start new wiki page explains detail much better respond public comment least gotten know someone maintained r depression wiki private_contact full text current version summary anyone acting helper invite accepts private contact e pm chat kind offsite communication early conversion showing either bad intention bad judgement either way unwise trust pm anytime seems like kind generous offer might perfectly well meaning unless solid rapport ha established wise idea point consider offer accept invitation communicate privately posting supportive reply publicly help people op response good quality educate inspire helper 1 9 90 rule http en wikipedia org wiki 1 25_rule_ internet_culture applies much doe anywhere else internet people struggling serious mental health issue often justifiably low tolerance disappointment high level ever changing emotional need unless helper able make 100 commitment every way long necessary offering personal inbox resource likely harm good mental health crisis line responder usually give name caller allowed request specific responder much healthier safer caller develop relationship agency whole analogously much safer healthier ops develop relationship community whole even trained responder generally allowed work high intensity situation alone partly availability mostly wider perspective preventing compassion fatigue helper get head someone whose mental health issue including suicidality often comorbid depression escalate pm conversation much harder others including r depression r suicidewatch moderator help contrary common assumption moderator see police pm observation many year people say pm consistently one least understanding mental health issue mental health support gap knowledge ability communicate effectively community input mitigates limitation reason someone truly help would want hide response community scrutiny helper concerned privacy keep mind self disclosure used supportively feeling detail problem use alt throwaway account restriction account age karma know internet used people exploit abuse others people want hide deceptive manipulative response everyone except victim many specifically target vulnerable mental health issue helper invite op talk privately give good supportive experience primed person vulnerable abuser sort cognitive priming tends particularly effective someone state mental health crisis people rely heuristic critical reasoning ops want talk privately posting wide open anonymous forum like reddit might best option although recommend allow ops request private contact asking support want please keep expectation realistic careful look history anyone offer pm opening,broken least understood rule helper may invite private contact first resort made new wiki explain,4792,144
"Regular Check-In Post, with important reminders about the No Private Contact and No Activism rules","Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, please ask us.  

********

**Please keep in mind that no activism, i.e.  advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues, is ever allowed here.**  

It's not that we're against activism.  We're strongly in favour of it.  But we've learned the hard way that it doesn't work within a dedicated support space, so with regret, we can't allow it any more.  Thanks for understanding.  *Please report any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's mainly about a cause or an issue rather than a request for personal support.*

*****

**Despite the fact that we always maintain a sticky post about it, we're still seeing a lot of violations of the private contact policy.

Reality is too DAMN boring for me!,"23 year old male here. I just found out that life is extremely boring and those tiny little moments of joy are very few and you just can't force them to happen. I've been always fascinated in creating stuff to entertain myself and others cause LIFE IS JUST too boring. But I burned out and I had to leave my creative part behind only to burn out again doing traditional BORING work. I was always the weird/crazy cousin who would host ""hounted attractions"" in my bedroom just to keep my other cousins entertained. I had an iCarly.com  rip-off kind of ""website"" that I created with some friends when I was barely 10. I made a lot of videos and movies using Sims characters and Habbo characters. I used to play a lot as a kid and had fun. I know all of that sounds stupid but the point is that I USED to be creative and joyful at some point of my life. But, as always, LIFE happened. I grew up, I developed a bunch of insecurities,  became a nerd, I turned out to be gay, I fell apart, developed a porn addiction, my social anxiety started to rise, stopped hanging out with my childhood friends, put all of my teen energy on having good grades and after graduating I decided to go into Business since I knew that I would be a financial burden to my single unemployed mother had I chosen a career related to  Film &amp; Arts in a third world country. But now, I graduated from college (I did great thankfully tho), and I've been working at a bank for more than year dealing with coding and database (of which I had no previous experience/knowledge on) while working remotely due to covid, spending most of my days locked in my room feeling empty, stressed out, and suicidal at how my life has turned out. I told to myself that next year I would apply to an international scholarship to do a master's degree because everyone in my circle is persuing that and I dont want to fall behind. But I still dont even know the master's degree I want to do. I'm stuck. It makes no sense to persue a master's degree in arts after graduating from Business School. I hate this gray career path that my 18 year old naive self chose and my 23 year old self decided to maintain. I feel like a zombie, my hair is falling out, my routine is a mess cause I can't maintain a routine, my face is aging fast, nothing makes sense, I'm extremely bored, I struggle doing minimal stuff. But I feel stuck and Idk what to do. I feel childish and dumb. I've been thinking about building an online social media platform to have an audience and monetize it so that I can become my own boss and create content that others find attractive or entertaining.

i hate life so much.,"hi,
my name is not important.
i am and have been since childhood severely deppressed.
my psychologist told me that medication is the only way for my mental health, which isnt an option for me since i live in iran and cant afford it...
which has the lowest money value in the world.
and the jobs (if lucky enough to find any) pay so little that i cant afford anything good.
since i was a child at the age of 7 till 11 i was sexualy abused and was threatened for it.
while being physically abused (being beaten) by bigger brother and mother that was so bad i often feared for my life.
right now with my english skills and video editing skills im lucky enough to have a job from home where i can translate and edit videos for a payment that equals to 25 us dollars per month.
not to make it political but...
iran is a dictatorship.
where if youre lgbt they kill you. if you protest they kill you. if youre an atheist they also kill you.
and right now there are power outages everyday that last maybe 2 or 4 hours a day.
so my editing and translation job is screwed up too.
i have had 2 suicide attempts ( pills and cutting my wrist )
both failed because i am a pathetic loser who cant do anything.
right now my mother has left the house and i am alone with my father, so i cook everyday.
and everyday that passes by.
i just feel afraid, alone, suicidal, hopeless, stressed, and having constant nightmares.
in my entire life there hasnt been a happy moment.

i had to say goodbye to my sweet boy today after finding out yesterday cancer is ravaging his body.,"
maximus came home almost four years ago, after enduring years of abuse. he was a 90 pound hunk of love who thought he weighed about 5 pounds. most handsome boy youve ever seen, a pitbull with the biggest block head that i love more than anything. he always had to be by my side, and i always had to be by his. i would lay on the floor with him any chance i had, and he would always angle his head down and just collapse his body into my lap. my boy loved to get dressed up- a bandana around his neck always made him sit up a little taller, and walk a little prouder. 

he got a rough start, having been used as a bait dog for the first half of his life. his body was permanently marked with scars from where evil scum had cut him repeatedly. when we found each other at the shelter, he had been there for 9 months and been adopted out and taken back quite a few times. ill never be able to wrap my mind around the fact no one else kept him, but im so thankful they didnt and that he waited for my family. he was missing almost all his teeth from chewing rocks, and was blind in his left eye. he has seen and experienced the worst humankind has to offer yet still had more love for us than you could ever imagine. he was my big, goofy, happy happy guy. the biggest regret i have is that i didnt get to him sooner than i did. 

Maximus didnt want to eat anything the past few days, and was more sluggish than usual. my mom took him to the vet yesterday just to make sure nothing was actually wrong, and they told us his red blood count was low and he needed a blood transfusion. it was serious but no reason he wont recover from it. we took him from there to emergency vet, where they ran tests and did scans. the vet said he has never seen anything like what was shown on those scans, that my sweet maximus was a very very sick little boy. the inside of his spleen was supposed to look like peanut butter, but instead it looked like chunky jelly with chunks and lumps he could not identify. his body had developed multiple tumors, which were cancerous. he had gone into “tumor lysis crisis” meaning that a large amount of the cancer cells that were comtained in these tumors died, and released their cancerous contents into his blood. they were killing his red blood cells and destroying the ability to regenerate any at all. his stomach had bloated 3x its normal size, even though it was just later in the day and yesterday morning it had looked fine. 

the vet discouraged us from treatment because he didnt see any possible way maximus could recover- putting him on treatment would only prolong his suffering and ensure he passed painfully. which is cruelly ironic, as putting him on treatment would keep my suffering at bay. but i have to do right by my boy. he’s been through too much and endured more than i can imagine, he was brought into this world in pain and i promised him when i brought him home he would leave it in love. i had to keep that promise. i love him more than it seems like my heart can handle, and making the right decision for him is the absolute utterly wrong decision for me. 

we got the vet this morning and despite not moving except to lift his head the past few days, he trotted off away from the building. i believe in the deepest place of my heart he knew what we were there for, and he was scared. he wouldnt let me turn him around back toward it, and the most he would take was two steps toward the building and then sit back down. i sat down with him and just sobbed. the thought of not having that big brown baby rips my heart into shreds and pierces my soul. 

we finally got him inside after i just sat with him and talked to him for about 15 minutes. ive never wanted to simply wait in a waiting room longer, but they called us right back. i prayed that the doctor was tied up and would take a while before she got back there, but no sooner did i finish thinking that she came in. i felt myself detach from my body at that point. i cant remember anything she said, but i know from the time she came in the room to the time she left the room was only about five minutes. 

my babys body was so tired, it had been fighting so hard for so long. he was gone before the injection to stop his heart was even finished. 

my world and heart suddenly felt so... empty. 
i was wailing in the vets office, the pain is so deep. the doctor told me our grief is only a reflection of our love, and i believe that 100%. i genuinely dont think i could love my boy even an OUNCE more because my little heart would give out. 

im back home now, my other dogs don’t understand why their brother isnt here. i never ever expected my maximus to be the first to go. i have two other senior dogs, and maximus is the youngest. i felt so sure i had at least 3-4 more years with him, and i feel so robbed. i wasnt remotely prepared, i had zero clue this was coming. the one comfort i have is i dont feel remorse over the amount of time i spent with him. i dont feel like i wish i wouldve sat with him and pet him more because that dog was at my side constantly. any spare second i have im laying with him. anywhere i go, hes the one that gets up in the car and rides with me. he loves a car ride. i always surprise him with a mcdouble, and the excitement he shows never ever ever gets old. im not prepared for all of that to be a fond memory. im scared, because i know in time ill forget how it felt to pet that big block head and i dont ever want to. i tried to memorize everything i could about the way he feels, so i hope its a long time before that happens. but for right now all i can think about is how it felt holding him and petting him and how it felt. 

ive been in a bad depressive state the past few weeks, and i dont know how im ever going to feel okay again. maximus is my comfort, i seek him out when im sad because of the comfort he brings, and now he’s not here to comfort me when i need it the most. 

please be kind to me, im not in a good place right now.

I'm also pretty nervous not going to lie. Has anyone else been admitted to anything like this? What should I expect? My anxiety has reached a critical breaking point, depression is pretty shit, PTSD ughh bad, and self harm coming back frequently soooo with a lot of researching and speaking with my Psychiatrist/GP they recommended I be admitted for a bit.

"I fucked up my life, and now I feel stuck.","I’m well aware that I fucked up my own life, albeit I didn’t realise that’s what I was doing at the time. Not until it was too late.

Fuck up one: Mental health. Just... fuck, man, I don’t even know how to fix this one. I’m just a damn mess. Everything overwhelms me, everything scares me, and I basically let fear win. I was bullied a lot in school, and had few friends, but I barely passed my GCSE’s anyways, I got mostly C’s. But then my friends all moved on and moved away, and I failed A-Levels because of anxiety. I was too stupid to understand what I was doing, too afraid to ask my teachers what to do, and too afraid to even make friends that could help me out. It got to the point where I was taking more and more sick days until I just stopped turning up, because the fear and the hopelessness won out. I gave up. And then I never did anything else. The longer I sat at home being afraid, the worse it got, and not I don’t even know **how** to be a regular person. How to look, act, talk... I just panic. I give up before I try.

Fuck up two: I believed love was going to save me. I had a boyfriend, from the age of 13 to 24, and I had convinced myself, and he had convinced me, that he was going to make it okay. He was normal, so he got a job, and started helping me with small goals, but he also enabled me and I let him. He promised we’d get a place together and someday get married, and I could either look after the home, or find a job when I was ready. It’s pathetic, but it was easy and not scary, so I believed it. I let him spoil me, got used to him spoiling me, and believed one day it would just “work out”. That we’d move in together and I’d gradually stop being scared, that doctors would one day fix me, but I had time because my boyfriend/eventual husband would help. But then at 24 he left me, and I realised I’d put every single egg in one basket. I had no savings, no social life, and no happiness. He was my everything. And I broke **hard** when he left.

Fuck up three: I gave up, and I let my family enable and coddle me, as I did with my ex. This is fucking shameful to admit... But I’m 27 now and I live with my mum. I have never moved out, because I planned to live with my ex, and he always promised we would “one day”. (He moved out of his parents house a year after we split.) I have never gone to college or university, because I don’t know what I have the skills to do. I have never had a job, because although it was because of my own failings, my mental health is so shit now that I go to interviews and burst into tears out of fear. My brain just shuts off. I don’t know how to care for myself, because my mum does everything herself, both because it’s easier than teaching me and doesn’t want another person getting in the way, and because she loves me and wants to make it easier for me. I know she has my best interest in heart, but it just makes me hate myself more because I’m useless. I’m a scared child in an adults body and I hate myself for it.

I know I have to change. I know I want to change. But finding a start point is hard. Fighting the bad days is hard. Fighting the urge to give up on everything, even life, is hard. The shame makes it harder, but I know I need, deserve, the shame, in order to force me to change. 

I keep hoping getting on the right meds will help... But fighting the doctors to change or even up my meds is like wrestling a bear, and they never actually do anything. The anxiety, the overthinking, the hopelessness, it’s all still there. I worry that my brain is permenantly broken.

Maybe all I can do is change my life. But change costs money, and willpower, and I don’t have much of either.

All I know is, I’m exactly the worst kind of person. The kind of person that is a waste of resources and money and time. I’m sorry. I want to be better. I will try to be better. But I wish there was a guidebook for this.

Life wasn't made for me. I'm not even sure what to do at this point.,"Every job I've had I've absolutely fucking despised. Right now I'm a cleaner and work nights so I don't have to interact with anyone but I hate the job. Every time I complain about it I get ""well someone has to do it"" or ""it's a really important job. Especially right now during a pandemic."" The thing while I'm there all I want to do is go home so I put in minimum effort and do it as quick as I can.

Ive never been in a relationship. I can't talk to anyone without getting extreme bouts of anxiety. I don't know why anyone would go out with me I've barely even got a personality and my life is such a mess it's a joke. 

I haven't made any new friend since highschool. The only  way I keep in contact with my old friends is when we used to play games together but I've been to depressed to do that in ages it just feels like effort. Effort to play and effort to talk.

I've got very little contact with my family. It's not even like we're on bad terms or anything we just don't talk. I've never got anything new to share about my life anyway so I don't even know what to talk about. 

I go weeks with out washing and my laundry never gets ironed or folded. I don't really eat out that much and try to eat healthy. I only drink water and go for walks whenever I've got the energy but that isn't that often. 

I try and put myself out there and find new hobbies all the time but nothing ever sticks. I force myself to go on hikes or to the beach or out to a bar at least once a week but I never enjoy myself.

It takes me hours to get out of bed in the morning. I sleep way too much and daydream an unhealthy amount. No matter what I do I always feel fatigued.

I don't even have a reason to be depressed. It's not like I've gone through some kind of trauma or been through a bad breakup. This is just who I am. It's who I've been for the last 5 years with no end in sight. I go to a psychologist I've been on various antidepressants for years but It never gets better.

I don't really want to die. I want like anything to he able to enjoy life. But I can't keep living like this where everything i do is an uphill battle. Where I've got to put in enormous amounts of effort just to do things that come naturally to most people and then not even be happy after putting in all the effort.

"I'm trying my very best in life, so that I can finally die","I have been suffering from depression, anxiety and mental illness for 11 years. Im currently 26 years old, with a useless degree, no full time job, no future. Since young I always studied hard and work hard. I wasn't a kid that played around, I spent all my time studying, I did well, not amazingly well, but above average. Adults promised me that if I continued to work hard like this, I would have an amazing future. 10 years down the road, I have a degree with Honors, 2 diplomas, I speak 3 languages and currently working on my 4th language. But I am so far from my dream and goal... due to graduating right in the middle of the covid19 pandemic, I can't find my ideal job, stuck with jumping from part time jobs to part time jobs. I question my existence everyday. I see people around me who are younger and way more successful... but yet I'm here, useless.   


I feel that I have so much to offer to the world, but due to this pandemic, due to the country that I'm born in, I have no opportunities, no chances to show the world what I can do. I always thought that being a Big fish in a small pond was great, I regret ever thinking like that. There is no opportunities, no hope, no chance in success in where I am born... 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I'm on suicide watch, attempted suicide a month back. I mentally breakdown everyday. I'm not young anymore... in a few months I will be 27, while people at age 18 are so successful in their careers and life. But I decided that I'm not going to rot away like this. I am lost but I will continue moving, so that even if I am unsure in the direction of life, I will still end up somewhere. I will push myself further, I will keep upgrading myself, reaching outside of my comfort zone, so that on the day of my 30th birthday, if I'm still unable to attain my dreams and aspirations, I can kill myself without regret. I can truly and sincerely, touch my heart and say

"Unemployed, Depressed, and Suicidal","Where to begin with this post that nobody will see? My depression has had a strong impact on my views toward our society. I was working a job that was proving to be more expensive to work at than it was worth, so I quit thinking finding new work would be a breeze with a labor shortage and all. I had to quit smoking weed of course to pass a drug test to find a new job. But that's the only anti-depressant that has ever worked for me. My only medicine and I can't even have it. Unfortunately it has not been a breeze, at all. It's got me thinking a lot of society, work in general, and how in the eyes of employers, I'm worthless. 
All of this has really lead me to feel like life is just pointless. The world is grim right now and all of my hopes and dreams have been sucked out of me after joining r/antiwork and understanding how fucked up things are.

Anyone feel like they don't even have the energy to be depressed anymore?,"I'm obviously still depressed as I suffer from the symptoms but lately I haven't been dredging on how much I hate my life, how lonely I am, etc. It's just too exhausting to think about.

How do you cope when you don’t see the point anymore?,"Over the past months, I have gone through a lot of life events that have been hard on me (the biggest being that I got new job that means I need to move to another city when WFH ends, the job itself is good but it’s stressful, I also went through the end of a romantic situationship and the end of friendships). 

I’m 30, soon to be 31. I don’t have friends, and I mean it. There isn’t anyone I could call if I needed help. If I got into an accident and had to be in the hospital for weeks, literally no one would notice that I’d be gone. 

For the past months that have been difficult for me, I have managed to maintain some kind of routine. I went on walks or runs, I ate healthy food, I was not at my best at work but I managed. I stopped drinking alcohol completely.

I’m 24 and feel like a child,"I’ve been depressed since I was a kid, but I’ve been really struggling since 2018 with feeling lost and really tired. I moved to a brand new city post college in 2019, but was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease right when I felt like I was starting to slowly turn things around which made me fall back into a hole. Then Covid hit, I started working for an extremely abusive boss who created a very toxic environment, and I’ve recently had to move back in with my dad and step mom since I quit my job after a year of being there. I like to believe my parents mean well in general, but they have both been narcissistic and pretty emotionally abusive my whole life. I have no sense of self, no concrete ambitions, and I feel like my depression is getting worse everyday. I don’t have a clue what it is I want to do with my life and I just don’t see anything for myself, but I don’t want to feel this way. I go to therapy, but I’m really struggling with finding myself. I feel like I’ve never had the ability to feel comfortable and like an individual except when I went to college on the other side of the country where I knew nobody at first. At the time I think I was slowly becoming my own person because of the life I was creating for myself. I just want to feel at peace and not so lost. Does anyone have any advice?

He’s only telling that because one time, when I was young, I asked him “what’s the meaning of life” out of curiousity. Guess he couldn’t answer that question, so he shamed me for asking. Last night he told me that yes you have struggles and you should just own it. Own your self harm scars. FUCKING hypocrite. You never gave a fuck, did you?

Dealing with the aftermath of breakdown,"In the summer of 2020 I had a complete meltdown. I've had breakdown's in my mental health before. I've dealing with depression since I was a teenager. But this time was different. It got to the point where I had visit the doctors, and I was prescribed sertraline. I also had to tell my family, friends and employer. As I was no longer capable of hiding it. 

Fast forward a year later and in theory I'am better. I'am not on anti-depressants anymore. As far as my family and friends are concerned I'am back to normal. 

I'am not as bad as I was. but I still don't feel right. I don't understand why this happened to me. I don't know what causes my depression. Whenever I think about it I feel terrible and I breakdown into tears.

Want to cry but can't,"I know this might be a feeling that many can relate to. I have had depression more or less half of my life, due to many different factors and things that have happened throughout my life.

I used to drink alcohol quite frequently and even smoke a lot of weed. However I have quit those things completely a couple months ago, and that has been another journey in itself.

I knew that indulging with different substances that make me high/drunk, I pushed the feelings of anxiety and depression aside, not making them disappear but just forgetting about them for the moment. Until they came back. 

For the last couple of months now I have been completely facing my shit, unable (or should I say unwilling) to ""escape"" by any means. 

I constantly have the feeling that I want to cry all the time. Not just a little, but I have the feeling that I want to let the floods out for real, got so much tension inside and I know I have the potential and that it would feel much better afterwards. But at the same time I just feel so empty and can't cry no matter how hard I try. 

It feels like those emotions somehow are trapped deep inside of me, and I would need a terrible reason to be able to ""let go"" of the pressure.

Why can’t I be happy?,"Hey, how are you? Hope you are all doing good. 

I’m a 22F who’s been struggling since I was 13 with depression and Anxiety. 
I had a very very traumatic childhood which stuffed me up for years, think about all the trauma you see on tv, I’ve been through most of it. I was raised by my drug addict mum and had a few different men raise me with mum but no one ever stayed so it was more my single mum.

I got depression when I was 13 and just started high school. It came out of no where and from then on, I was fucked. 
I was bullied and never could keep friends (I still don’t have any friends now, I don’t know why I can’t keep them).
I left school in grade 9 and never finished schooling because of depression. Since then I’ve practically been bed/ house ridden. 

I’ve been to psychologists and I’ve talked about my childhood. That is all behind me now, I don’t brood on it nor do I have PTSD anymore from it. 

So, i struggle to be happy, I want to be happy but I can’t seem to be. I’ve tried medication from the doctor but it never has worked on me.
I have a loving partner and im happy IN the relationship however that’s the only thing im happy about and outside that there is no happiness with life. 

I don’t have a job, I don’t have any friend (can’t keep them), I don’t have any hobbies and im overall just miserable.
Weekends I don’t do anything, holidays I don’t do anything, it’s just bleak. And when I do try to do something fun, it don’t enjoy it. 

I just want to be happy and have a full, happy life but for some reason my head is not letting me.

I just want support from people who are similar to me and maybe share some helpful tips.

I feel broken beyond repair,"I’m having this overwhelming feeling lately that I’m not right. I feel like the longer I go on the more broken I get. I feel like I’m missing pieces, I don’t know how to describe it properly. It almost feels horrific, the only way I can put it is like I’ve had a whole bunch of body parts amputated over the years and I feel irreversibly disfigured. But mentally. And not all at once, but gradually over time. Like one day I might wake up and look down to see my leg is gone or my hand is missing fingers. It makes me feel sick. It’s like body horror but only I can see it or feel it. 

I will never be the same again and the further I go on the more mutilated it get. It feels like something puts me on a surgical table and injects me with a sedative so I can’t move, but I can still see and still feel it and then it straps me down and takes pieces of me and I can only watch, wide eyed and powerless. Then it throws me back out into the world to figure out how to come to terms with my new disfigurements. It’s horrific but I’m too numb and tired to scream or react. It’s like a waking nightmare and no one can see it but me.

I can’t explain it properly. But I’m trapped in this feeling and I’m silently horrified. But I’m also tired.

"her over protective mother made up break up, now I'm back to this subreddit, yaaaay","tldr: my[17] gfs[16] over protective mother made us break up over my mere existence so here's a rant to ignore



for context I live in Africa, (zimbabwe)
so it's already bad enough having parent from this side cause boy-girl interaction automatically = pregnancy and not finishing school in the eyes of the Boomer fucking fucks, and don't get me wrong on cases rarer than a fucking mewtoo it sometimes is the case but goddamn it we never did anything wrong 

long story fucking short
she (the mother) went through my gfs phone and saw she had a boyfriend Because privacy is a western ideology apparently and she's actively taking all her electronics and told her to break up with me immediately

grand
see those things happen sure but doesn't help that as I tried to comfort her telling her everything will be okay and I don't wanna leave her and we can plan everything in advance and could ""fake break up"" , her mother just so happened to yank the phone out of her hand and read everything 
so ruined all the plans..this was literally 30 minutes ago too..
and just let just break up cause I don't wanna get her in any more trouble

the only 3 years of my life I wasn't fucking depressed and suicidal, and have not walked into traffic with the intention of just giving up on it all
I really can't move on with the way this ended,
if I can't have her I don't really want anyone else

all this happens 3 weeks before my 18th birthday too.

this started as a rant but now I'm crying my eyes out.

In 30s feeling hopeless,"I had always considered myself someone with a booming amount of optimism, I believe most people would say so that had been in my life. I've always struggled with some form of depression or hopeless thinking throughout my life but I bounce back. I have had a bit of a rough life growing up as a kid making me not so close with my family. I also moved out of state as an adult and don't have many friends in this state. I'm in my 30s and for the past couple years I feel more and more hopeless.

Several years ago I was dating someone and I thought it was serious, we lived together for nearly two years. I made a career change -- only after thoroughly discussing it with my partner at the time and planning our future based on this -- my partner was also getting a promotion. Right when the last bit of my savings had been spent, my partner left me and I had to find a new place to live. It was frustrating -- not because of leaving me but because she was never straight forward and honest, was always too polished, it was like talking to a politician or tech support. It made me feel like I wasn't even worth being honest to. A few months later she finally admitted to having feelings for a co-worker that she never admitted to before this, but she said later she didn't pursue it.

I was angry for a long time after this as my heart was broken over someone I loved and my financial situation crumbled. I went home for the holidays and tried for the first time to console to family members who told me who used it as an opportunity to punch down on me. I vowed to not see them again.

I ended up speaking to this ex again about half a year later, constantly walking on egg shells letting her know if she ever wanted to stop talking we could. She became more and more distant but wouldn't be straight forward. I am fortunate enough to have dated other people to know not everyone is this manipulative. We got in an argument and she said she wanted to go on a break from talking I said ""if you don't want to talk ever again just say it"" and she wouldn't say it, just ""she wanted to go on a break from talking and I can't explain why but it isn't out of anger"". Of course she blocked me and that was like a year ago. I just only ever wanted honesty but never got it once from her. I've come to accept that it is unlikely there was any love from this person.

&amp;#x200B;

This was all during a time when my housemate destroyed my home, she had a mental breakdown and hadn't paid rent for 5 months. I was trying to get off the lease. Unfortunately I had paid rent that whole time and have to deal with this hit to my credit when I refused to resign the lease, therefore causing us to be evicted but I was unwilling to keep living with a person who refused to pay rent. She threatened my landlord's life and constantly blew up my phone and cursed at me (I was staying somewhere else, not dealing with her, still paying rent in a place I didn't live).

&amp;#x200B;

I now live in destitute a year later -- two since breaking up. An old friend asked to video chat for a short bit and said I looked like the life had been sucked from me, looked at me in horror.

&amp;#x200B;

I have had tooth pain that I ignore. I used to be a healthy vegetarian, now nearly all my meals are fast food. I used to not smoke but now I am a smoker. I have taken up habits that accelerate my life. I am in therapy right now, and have been for two years. I just wish this one person could've ever been honest to me, just said they hated me or they in fact never did want to talk to me again. I wish the optimism wasn't stripped from my bones. I look back on my life and feel as if I am approaching the ""bad ending"". I have no support network anymore, the one friend I video chatted was a girl I used to date who was telling me about the new guy she is dating. I started to cry after, from looking at her and seeing me in the video, to seeing how far I've fallen compared to everyone. I only see life as a thing to be grinded away. I'm in my thirties and am as poor as I've ever been, I've only ever been dumped and I feel the things I hoped to have at this point -- friends, a lover, possibly thinking about a family, a permanent home -- I don't have and doubt I will ever have. I grow older and less able to acquire skills to make me happy.

How can I fix friendships after isolating myself due to depression?,"I need (F 30) some advice on how I can reach out to my friends after being distant for a few months. Let’s call them friend A and B. 

In December 2020 I started getting really depressed due to a highly stressful job, the fact that for the first time ever I’d be spending Christmas alone (covid lockdowns, family far away) and finding out that a close family member has cancer. 

For New Years I went to friend A’s house and she asked me about my relative and the cancer treatment, but I kept getting interrupted while other people in the background were making jokes and my friend wasn’t really listening. She was like, Oh sorry you were saying, go on…I was feeling highly sensitive and about to cry but she wasn’t listening to what I had to say. I felt shut down but I wasn’t gonna let this be a reason for getting mad at her.  

Now friend B, I’ve known most of my life, almost 20 years. We wished each other happy New Years and I asked her when she’s free to FaceTime. Again, I was a wreck, just spent Christmas alone, had intrusive thoughts about my relative. I really needed to talk to her. I get that Christmas time is busy but she got back to me around Jan 13 “we can FaceTime tomorrow”

That was 2 weeks later and in those 2 weeks my mental health declined even more. At this point, I didn’t even feel like texting her back right away. I texted her a few days later and admitted that I’m in a bad headspace and I’ll FaceTime her in a few days. But I didn’t. 

My mental health kept getting worse, I wasn’t taking care of myself, skipped showers, I was binging on unhealthy foods, not exercising, had insomnia, headaches, neglected to take care of things around the house. And I couldn’t stop crying. 

I’d cry soon after waking up, while driving to work, I’d cry on my lunch breaks, and when I got home. I started developing intrusive thoughts, thinking what is the point of it all, how I hate the way my life turned out, etc.

Things got REALLY bad. Friend A and B texted me on my birthday (end of Feb) and it took me days to even read the messages, and text back. Everything, even the smallest tasks took so much effort. 
Literally on my birthday, I kept getting messages from people and I wanted to throw my phone out the window. It wasn’t a happy birthday. I was at work and on my lunch break, went for a drive to get a coffee and again started bawling my eyes out. 

I thanked them for the wishes and didn’t say anything else. Now fast forward to mid March, it’s friend B’s birthday. I wished her a happy birthday but she never texted back.
Which I understand. My lack of communication could’ve been taken the wrong way as I never explained to them what I was truly going through. 

I think about my two friends all the time, and I wish I hadn’t fucked up our friendships. I want to reach out and apologize but I don’t even know where to start. We’re now in July…I was basically a ghost for 6 months. 

I never suffered from such deep depression in my whole life, it was so bad that even the smallest tasks took a lot of effort. I become so isolated, desperately tried to work on myself.

I am just so sorry. I wish I could be there for some of you in person.,"I came looking for this group tonight because I find great value in writing things out. It helps me process my emotions. And then frequently when I write things out, I'm like amazed at what comes out from me.  I've been on an anti-depressant for many years, and I like it, it does make me feel stable, but it's contributed significantly to my weight gain and I've cried so hard the past couple of days because I've gotten back from my main doctor. And this may not make sense to anyone else that hasn't had weight issues - but I did not realize how bad it got. And I think that's the overarching issue (the depression) that's causing the imbalance in my life. Other things that I think I've developed resilience for now seem seriously irritating and it's like I have nothing to block out or temper the emotions. Everything irritates me or makes me depressed. The weight gain/depression is a bit of a cycle. I'm depressed and on anti-depressants, so I've gained weight. And because I've gained weight, I don't feel as bright and shiny as I used to. 

Anyway - I know this may mean jack. And I've been there before where someone's said sorry to me, and I'm like, ""I don't need your apology, I need a fucking solution."" 

But I just want to truly say, I am so sorry for the clear pain that present in so many of these posts. So many of you are going through things that are so unfair, and I remember people used to counter with telling me that life is not fair, but then it's like, ""Yeah, but I'm still resentful and I have to deal with this."" 

Please delete if not allowed, and I know sorry from a stranger is useless, but it's just how I feel. I just looked up the word sorrow and yeah, the word unfair is mentioned in it.

Finding humor in suicide?,"Anybody else use humor as a way to cope with suicidal thoughts and urges? 

When I was 8 I thought I should kill myself for the first time, and I joked to myself about how I could do something crazy - like rob a bank or steal a lambo for a joy ride, stuff like that instead. Things that might get me killed but would probably be way more fun. I thought this as a joke and it made me feel better because I remembered there were good things in life, even if I couldn’t see them or even confirm they existed.

These days I joke to myself - this is what I’m doing instead of killing myself today. I’m not sure that most would see the humor in that - kind of morbid. Like - hey why clean the dishes? Well, I guess I could kill myself instead? Nah I’ll just clean the dishes for now…

sometimes i just miss having someone,"i miss having someone that noticed how i feel, even if he couldnt do anything, at least he stayed with me...he understood me

sometimes i just miss him so much...

i wish i wasnt alone anymore

the only thing i ever wanted was to not be alone anymore...i just wanted someone that gave even a little fuck about me, at least cared a little

instead all my family is stressed, angry, tired, and i have to keep the little sanity and emotion i have so no one falls down but i cant, i just cant anymore, im tired, im sad, i just wish someone took me away from all this for as long as he can

i couldnt even get him back...i couldnt even do that right

i thought maybe if i spoke to him, everything would go back to how it was before, my other friend did that and it went extremely well for her...why couldnt it go well for me too?

i cant find a boyfriend, i cant meet people, i cant even bring back people from the past that actually understood me, im alone

i tried so hard and still...im alone

i've always wanted someone to help me, since i was young, i always wanted someone to appear already and save me

i thought, maybe if i whistand a little more, someone will come eventually, and maybe everything would be the same, but at least, when everything's over, i'll have someone to play with

so i did, and it never got better, and no one came.

i tried so hard to be nice to everyone and to make everyone happy and no matter what i tried i was still alone, and i was still me

im still alone...i just wish someone appeared already

what's wrong with me?

why doesnt anyone choose me?

they all found someone, all my friends, someone came for them

i had so much hope...i really thought it was gonna be my year finally

i thought i wasnt gonna be alone on my birthday again, or alone on christmas, or new years, or valentine's day...i thought i could celebrate all of them again and not feel out of place...

Too depressed to seek help,"I (22f) have been struggling with my mentl health since i was a little kid. I've been in and out of therapy since I was 10, and things are at a huge low at the moment.  
I actually went to my GP last year to get myself an appointment with a new therapist. I had one phone call with the therapist and then I ghosted them (because i got back with my ex bf and thought that would solve everything) and haven't been back to the GP since. I feel like that was my last window of opportunity to get help, because i went down hill very fast after that. Idk. this might sound stupid but i feel like i'm too unwell now to advocate for myself. Making another GP appointment sounds like a huge task, especially since i feel so guilty for ghosting my last therapist. But i know i need help. big time.

I'm afraid of becoming depressed again,"Hey guys.

First of all I wan't you to know that if reading about people recovering is something that puts pressure on you or triggers you in any way better stop reading. I know that back when I was severely depressed I didn't want to hear from people that got healthy again because it made me feel like a failure because I couldn't seem to get there. It's totally fine if you ignore my post. 

I am just looking for advice from people that have overcome depression to hopefully find out that I am not alone with this. I got diagnosed with severe depression back in January 2018 after already suffering for 3 months without knowing what was up. I got on meds and into therapy, went through many ups and downs and finally went back to university in June 2019. Then in January 2020 I finally felt like I was completely my old self again, stopped taking my meds and going to therapy.

The pandemic hit and of course it was hard for me to be back at home with myself after I was finally back out living life after almost two years. But I still think I managed it quite well. Down days were only normal down days (once you've had depression you really get the difference between being down like a normal person and being down like a depressed one) and they passed usually within half a week or so.  

But now to the reason of my post: they don't seem to pass lately. It's been over a month of me not feeling good. In the sense of: I get ""sick"" a lot (not sure if you know what I mean...it's actually being physically sick but knowing that it's rooted in you not wanting to get out of bed - if that makes sense?) I don't feel like meeting my friends and often cancel, saying I have to study - even tough I don't really plan on studying anyway. I don't seem to see the fun in things I normally like and if I do it fades quickly. I also don't sleep well - it's been a long time since I slept through a night. And of course the classic: I often feel useless and sad, even though I know that I have many people in my life that love me. 

So I know many of these things can be symptoms of depression. I also know that many of these feelings are also common in people who are not depressed. My problem is that I know how I was when I was depressed and it's not that bad now. So I don't think I am depressed again but it still worries me. I am just scared that it will come back - actually really scared. Because (I don't think I have to tell any of you) it's hell to be depressed. 

Has anyone else experienced this? I know statistically it's not likely that I will have another episode. Or does anyone have any advice for me? 

I am sorry if my post is confusing, I just wanted to vent somewhere because it is really hard to explain any of this to people that have never been depressed  and also I don't want my family and friends to worry as long as it's not that bad...",wegwerfacountchen,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/odnqqj/im_afraid_of_becoming_depressed_again/,hey guy first wan know reading people recovering something put pressure trigger way better stop reading know back wa severely depressed want hear people got healthy made feel like failure seem get totally fine ignore post looking advice people overcome depression hopefully find alone got diagnosed severe depression back january 2018 already suffering 3 month without knowing wa got med therapy went many ups finally went back university june 2019 january 2020 finally felt like wa completely old self stopped taking med going therapy pandemic hit course wa hard back home wa finally back living life almost two year still think managed quite well day normal day depression really get difference like normal person like depressed one passed usually within half week reason post seem pas lately month feeling good sense get sick lot sure know mean actually physically sick knowing rooted wanting get bed make sense feel like meeting friend often cancel saying study even tough really plan studying anyway seem see fun thing normally like fade quickly also sleep well long time since slept night course classic often feel useless sad even though know many people life love know many thing symptom depression also know many feeling also common people depressed problem know wa wa depressed bad think depressed still worry scared come back actually really scared think tell hell depressed ha anyone else experienced know statistically likely another episode doe anyone advice sorry post confusing wanted vent somewhere really hard explain people never depressed also want family friend worry long bad,afraid becoming depressed,2860,38
What to do next?,"Ive been trying for so long. Told my family about my depression and they act like they care then forget the next day. I finally managed to ask for professional help from a doctor and my school. Im 15, my parents are divorced. I live with my mum and my dad lives some 2,000 kilometres away. I moved 2 times in the past year and due to that I lost my friends so I don't have anyone to rely on, and im a year 9 so I friend groups and so on have been already made and I can't really befriend anyone at this point. Ive been struggling the past 3 weeks with anxiety and depression and not wanting to wake up in the morning for school. And to add to injury my mum is now saying im gonna go back to my dads and will have to start working and drop my education, which I don't want to do, and I don't want to make issues for my dad either as he is a driver so he drives 800km per day so he is rarely at home and barely gets sleep. I just don't know what to do at this point, talking about will not help since they will just act like nothing happened, and my dad can't support me as he is over 2k km away, and he isn't the best dad either but still cares enough to see that im hurting and need help but can't do much.

Been a tough weekend - home alone on July 4th - what's the point after you've thoroughly damaged your body/mind?,"(Starting my senior year of college) - posted in r/suicidewatch as well. 

September 2017:  
Body dysmorphia leads me to believe I have gynecomastia. Plastic surgery research occupies most of my time. Turns out to be basically negligible and a case that goes away if I lose weight (learned this much later on).

December 2017:  
After 6 scheduled (and cancelled) surgery dates with plastic surgeons to remove the gynecomastia, my parents recommend that I see our doctor and talk about depression. I oblige.

January 2018:  
After my first visit with the doctor, I start taking Zoloft 25mg 1x/day.

March 2018:  
I up the dosage to 50mg/day. Start complaining to doctor about ""emotional numbness"" and taper back down to 25mg 2x/day.

April 2018:  
I'm at a bar and get cold clocked (to this day I still do not know who hit me). Clean mandibular fracture and broken in two places. Wired shut for 4 weeks after that.

August 2018:  
Decide I'm good and that I don't need Zoloft anymore (was also very overweight). Go off the drug and two weeks later, I total my '01 BMW e46 M3 that I bought a year prior after running a stop light I didn't see. T-boned a taxi.

September 2018:  
Researching that Zoloft weakens bone density and increases risk of fractures by up to 75%. Thought of ""if you weren't on Zoloft, your jaw wouldn't have broken"" starts to grow in my head. call my mom on my birthday, mention suicide for the first time. She says I ""can't leave this earth"" in tears.

October 2018:  
Meet a new girl, we become boyfriend and girlfriend.

April 2019:  
I buy a penis enlargement device ""just because"" to see if I can get any bigger for my gf at the time. And mind you, I was not insecure about my size to begin with, I just wanted to see if it could get bigger. I ended up suffering an injury from doing too much, too fast that left my penis in a ""hard flaccid"" state sometimes, and actually lost a bit of length and girth because of it. This leads to a lot of anxiety and depression that I still experience to this day.

May 2019:  
Depressed, I decide to start Zoloft again. 25mg 1x/day.

September 2019:  
I go off of Zoloft again. Girlfriend and I break up.

October 2019 - January 2021:  
Working full-time, met another girl around Feb 2020 that I dated up until recently. Things we just OK. Covid didn't make things any easier, but whatever.

February 2021:  
I approach a urologist about the potential of Zoloft ruining my sex drive, and that's the reason I can't perform like I used to. I start doing research and come across Wellbutrin. I start taking Wellbutrin 100mg SR 1x/day.

March 2021:  
I go off of Wellbutrin.

\*\*\*Wellbutrin 100mg/1x per day continues for month-long streaks coupled with about a month off. This cycle repeats itself for about 3 months up until the middle of this past June.

\- - - - - - - - - - -

End of June 2021:  
I come across a bunch of photos of myself a year or two prior to the gynecomastia/Zoloft phase. Look myself and love what I see. My face looked different. I remember my penis looking and functioning the way it used to. I remember the way my teeth pressed together when I closed my mouth, and how my jaw didn't click everytime I opened it or when I gave my girlfriend oral.

\*\*first scare here\*\* (July 2, 2021):  
I take my father's competition ruger out of the case next to his bed (I'm at my parent's house here). I hold it. I look at it. I wonder... I don't cry or whatever. I try to fight. I try to think about what I can do differently, but nothing really happens. I put the gun back in its case, and I decide to light a bowl and get high. I pass out at the top of my parent's stairs until 2pm in the afternoon. I had off of work, and the rest of the family is at our vacation house, so I was home alone.

July 3, 2021:  
I decide to do something, so I book a tee time and drop a 72 on 18-holes from the tips here at our home course, with a 33 (-3) on the back nine. Golf is a big passion of mine, and I have my own horror stories of trying to play in college/throughout highschool that I won't get into. I've played golf my entire life.

\- - -

July 4, 2021 (today):

I wake up, depressed again. Not high this time, but I start reading about people on psychiatric medications and how it can permanently mess them up. I start thinking about everything, from how my dick is fucked up, to how my face looks different from a jaw fracture I suffered because I chose to take antidepressants (and how the SSRIs probably weakened my bone density), how I pissed away good relationships with good women. Everything.

I go back upstairs and take my Dad's ruger out again. I look at it. This time I cry a little bit. I start to realize I'm unstable and the only thing holding me back is that I really don't know how to operate a ruger, and the magazines are out (though there are bullets in the magazines). I frighten myself again, and put it back in the case. I cry to God a bit here and say ""I'm really having a tough time here man. I don't know what to do.""

I've got a therapist and I take medication. There is a lot more I could do around exercise, meditation etc. 

My big issue is feeling like I'm out of time to really have a fulfilling life. I'm so unsure about my relationship, don't have kids, don't have friends. Recently got a new job as a business analyst which is stressful but the pay is good so I'm happy about that.

Recently one of the few people I confided in, a colleague, decided she couldn't help me and didn't want to talk to me anymore. Ultimately everyone has one life and I can understand not wanting to fill that with depressed people, but it hurt a lot.

It's crazy how much motivation affects life,"Most days, even if I want to spend more time doing a favorite hobby of mine and have been wanting to for the past few years, I can't being myself to do anything but browse social media and sleep. 9.5/10 times I say I wanna do a hobby, I don't end up fulfilling that want. Doing anything but sleep just feels like it takes too much effort and energy.

When my sibling arrives home after their long day of work and I see them though, suddenly feelings of motivation and happiness rushes to my brain because other family members I live with is emotionally abusive, and so my sibling is the only person who doesn't tell me trash has more worth than me and I enjoy being around. When they arrive home, it's as if everything is as easy to do as thinking it and 500lbs weights have been lifted off

I think my mother thinks I'm weak because of my depression and anxiety.,"So I have depression and tend to get social anxiety. This results in a self-deprecating outlook combined with struggling to talk to people properly and speak up in work.

I had an argument with my mother which was honestly pretty stupid and when I got upset by something she said, she told me that if I get upset by that then God forbid what would happen to me when I ""really get hurt"" in the future. That if anything bad happens to me like a shitty relationship or something, I'm going to be too down on myself and too much of a doormat to do anything and that if I ever find myself in that kind of situation with an actually terrible person, she thinks it would break me. 

I got offended by this. Because I know I struggle with social situations a lot and with self deprecation, but I know I'm not a push over. I've stood up for myself before and I don't tend to freeze with confrontation. My first instinct is usually to just leave and not give that person the time of day. But she thinks that I, a 21 year adult, will somehow be broken at the slightest verbal assault. 

It's frustrating to hear that and it makes me feel as though she thinks I'm weak because of my mental illness.",throwaway-oh-throw,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/odgqfy/i_think_my_mother_thinks_im_weak_because_of_my/,depression tend get social anxiety result self deprecating outlook combined struggling talk people properly speak work argument mother wa honestly pretty stupid got upset something said told get upset god forbid would happen really get hurt future anything bad happens like shitty relationship something going much doormat anything ever find kind situation actually terrible person think would break got offended know struggle social situation lot self deprecation know push stood tend freeze confrontation first instinct usually leave give person time day think 21 year adult somehow broken slightest verbal assault frustrating hear make feel though think weak mental illness,think mother think weak depression anxiety,1186,71

Pretending to be happy everyday. My mom acts like she understands what my depression is like but she can’t. She hasn’t gone thru that sort of thing. She assumes my depression is more minor now that I can do the bare minimum everyday but it’s never been minor at all. She always talks about how my depression affects her and my family when I’m trying to express how I’m feeling. It’s frustrating. I could never imagine telling her the truth and what almost happened in grade 11 when I considered overdosing on my meds. Because I never tried to do it she never knew. Though it sounds more minor than other peoples stories it rlly affected me. Getting to that point where u consider suicide every day is rlly scary. I’m considering telling my therapist about it because I haven’t been truthful with everything.

"How can you be so alone ,when you are the one secluding yourself from society","First time posting. I just keep thinking about what my Uncle Doug did at 21. Take his own life. I don't think I'm that low, always said I don't believe in that. Somedays I feel so lonely I might as well not be here, but I'm just searching for belonging , someone to ask to me to be apart of their social gathering, even without my active searching to include myself and more seclude myself. My house has become a jail and I mainly go to sleep to escape any anxiety or other responsibility.  

I am 28 I think, I haven't celebrated a Birthday since I turned 18. I used to celebrate any and every holiday just to ""have fun"" or socialize but now it's just another day. Tomorrow is 4th of July. I would love to go to a lake , be with friends , float on a boat, fish ,laugh.

Laugh....it's been a while since I've sincerely laughed. My day goes wake up ,sit in bed scroll through social media, anxiety attack , see my husband have an uncomfortable emotional conversation , get dressed ,go to work , supervise ungrateful assholes ,get blamed for shit that is their fault and they can't handle emotionally , come home , mope in the fact I can't understand their logic for being assholes , blame myself for their being assholes and I am not a good enough leader for them , I am just a failure. Maybe cry, yell at my husband out of frustration , drink , eat like shit , go to sleep. I try to sleep at least 12 hours a day not to stress my husband out with what a burden I have become. I don't drink often, but I drink to escape the pain and the wrong reason. We both have alcoholism in our family and I feel this has contributed , among other thing, to our growing void in our marriage. I used to be bubbly, excited , giggly ,interested and motivated . I had so much going for myself in life ....now I just sulk and he put it correctly, we have been nothing but room mates for 6 years. 

Years, so much has happend , but I don't feel it is anything scarring enough for me to feel the way I feel. I studied epidemiology,  the gut brain connection and learned as much as I can about depression. I know what I can do to change it, but I choose to stay in my comfort zone and actually adore the sad empathy I get from my husband . Fucking pathetic.  I feel I have done nothing but bring him down. I am his anchor, but anchoring him from being happy now. 

I always say he deserves more than me, he and I used to work out together helped each other through college and have worked so hard to get to where we are. Then 2020. 2020 to most people say Corona , no life happend to us. He got injured at a job, had to quit, in a lawsuit which we will probably just waste of time and emotional energy, and we found out we can't have kids. We are having to move out of house as we can't afford it anymore. Our job sucks , just running our hope for happiness as they just drive us by production, replaceable by any means. He doesn't make what he used to, obviously. We haven't had a vacation in 2 years. 

The only thing I have to look forward to is selling this house and only cleaning an apartment. My dogs are entertaining and so loving. They are the only thing keeping me going lately. 

I sat on a lawn mower today thinking about how lonely I am. Although my husband is a great support and I could call family, I feel so alone. I have drifted so far from reality I am lost in my mind thinking that no one loves me, you are the reason you have no friends and you should just not wake up. It's a slow death, as I treat my body horribly , let my health be the last worry and I could care less. I just want to die of natural cause , that seems easier than giving the grief to my husband for suicide. He doesn't deserve that sadness. I love him so much, I just wish I could do anything. I can, I just choose not to. What happend to me, where did I lose myself. I have no plans for a future,  it's so blurry. 

I cried the other day to my aunt who has had far worse in life. She's been addicted , shot , jail ,single mom of 2 . I thought I was a bitch for moping about my small struggles. She was great and listened made sure I knew was worth a damn, but a bandaid falls off a aging reservoir quickly.  

These are my thoughts,  probably sound like a lot of batching. I really have no reason to butch, but I'm just so lonely.

But I recently lost my job because they found out I was smoking pot to help me sleep and they laid me off with no warning or chance to take another test. I've spent most of the past week in bed scrolling reddit or sleeping. I can't seem to find the energy or will to do anything else. I don't want to play video games anymore, talk to the 3 friends I have left, or even watch any TV shows or movies. My brain just doesn't care. Why is finding a psychiatrist so damn hard? All I've heard back from any doctors I've contacted is ""see a therapist and get a recommendation"" or ""I don't have time for new patients"". Everyone's answer when talking to someone with mental illnesses is always ""you should go see someone about that"" and now that I'm actually trying, it seems impossible.

Care to listen to a 17 yr old's woes?,"So, I've been alone for pretty much as long as I can remember. While my family is nice enough, I don't really have much of a connection with them. I really only talk to them when I need something, and in turn they ramble on about any and everything. I've never had any close friends, only a few friendships that fell apart when I realized that we didn't mesh well. 

I dropped out of school last November, because my increasing depression became too much for me to be able to continue studying. After I got on medication, I started feeling much better, so I got a part-time job. I enjoy my job, but it saps every bit of energy I have, so I hardly ever have any left for what I actually want to do.

Combine this with my increasing loneliness, and I would very much like to commit die lately.

External Factors harming recovery,"Hey, so I have posted a few places for support but no community has given me any so I'm trying here.

Backstory: I've always struggles with depression and intrusive thought usually brought on by my father who is verbally abusive. He likes turning anything good to something negative. 

About me: 
I'm 20 this year and studying, I moved out of parent's place and was doing so good until Covid decided to make us poor so I had to go back to my parents. 

I've been diagnosed with depression and bipolar and am pretty familiar with when to know a manic episode is coming but my depression just hits me low.

All my colleagues always call me floaty because I'm happy and chill by nature. I never fight and always ignore drama and conflict. 

Here I get to the point:
My family was recently attacked by a neighbor and my dad defended us by stabbing him so he went to jail for bail. In that time my mom and I were alone and living peacefully without problems or drama but my dad was suffering in jail and we kept on working to fairly get him out so he was the victim. 

I was really worried about my dad coming home because he's always been very negative and makes anything a problem. He came back a nice, modest man who's grateful for everything. This however lasted only a week and once again everything in my home is cold and dark. We had a party and one of the guests accidentally packed his phone in when leaving. My dad went crazy accusing her of theft and screaming at us even though I got the phone back immediately. I had a panic attack due to all the screaming and anger.

Today nobody in the house is talking, everything is tense.
I'm just depressed and disappointed. I've been crying and nothing is happy anymore. The whole situation just completely through me of while I had been stable and happy till now.

We have an apartment by the beach where I want to flee since I can still have online class from there and my workplace allows me to travel since we serve the whole country so I can go there and still work and study without any additional moving or trouble Problem is that our country has some limits on traveling between states right now, however the apartment there is on my name and I could say I'm going home.

Should I stick it out at home or try to go? I know I cannot reject my father because his fragile yet his behavior is affecting my mental health.

Parents impeding progress,"Advice for parents being insulting about mental illness without realising? I've had diagnosed depression and anxiety for 6 years, and I've made a lot of progress in my ability to manage it. I've also done a lot of work to help my parents understand how this illness affects my life. They have made significant progress, but I've come to accept they will never fully understand, and that it's generally better to talk to friends about my down times. 

Our relationship is mostly fine at this stage, but one parent will still make very hurtful remarks that I have a hard time shaking. For example today I said to my mum, '...if you're anything like me and have a hard time relaxing -' and she laughed and scoffed and disbelievingly said, 'do you?'

I find it very hard to let go of these comments. I still remember when about three years ago how her and my dad would laugh about how messy my car was, not realising that this is a symptom of my illness and it's difficult for me to discuss.

Why aren’t you talking?

GEORGIE

Because I think he’s going to destroy himself, and anyone who lets him get too close. And I don’t want that to include me or Melanie.

MARTIN

Maybe he just needs some help.

GEORGIE

I did help him, as much as I safely could, but he just carried on anyway.

MARTIN

(overlapping) Yeah, he’ll do that.

GEORGIE

I realized if I kept trying it was gonna hurt me more than I was willing to accept.

MARTIN

Well, sometimes the helping people hurts.

GEORGIE

Sure, but that doesn’t mean everything painful helps.

Sometimes people have problems that will wreck you long before you can make a dent in them,and some people don’t want help, they just want other people suffering with them.

MARTIN

John doesn’t want that.

GEORGIE

He doesn’t know what he wants. And from the sound of things he’s run out of time to figure it out.

MARTIN

It’s easy to pass judgment from the outside.

GEORGIE

One more reason to stay on the outside and watch.

......... 

MELANIE

Right, right. Okay. I know… that is why I ruined my first four sessions and almost torpedoed the chance at a genuinely really good therapist, because I was so paranoid that she was going to turn out to be some – some thing trying to manipulate me. But no, she’s not full of spiders, or made of wax, or wearing the therapist’s skin or whatever, she’s just a well-trained professional who I am paying to help me.

ARCHIVIST

Okay. (sigh) It’s just… the Web can be subtle, you understand?

MELANIE

And? For all you know its plan is to paralyze you with indecision. Leaving you sitting here, terrified that everything you do is somehow all part of its grand plan. And who do you think that fear is gonna feed?

........ 

The Lonely is possibly the most insidious of the powers, I believe. Certainly it is the one that most delights and having you do its work for it, even the spiders seem to have a hard time matching it for sheer seductiveness. (hmph) Time to yourself. Self-care. Putting yourself first. Not being a burden on those you care about. Doesn’t even need to tell you any lies – just waits for the lies you tell yourself.

We’re all well aware that with Peter Lukas in charge of the Institute, it’s a very real danger to all of us. We are trying.

I struggle to care for myself,"I was diagnosed with severe depression when I was about 13 years old and I am now 21. For the majority of the past 8 years I never really struggled with showering or brushing my teeth etc. however, over the past year I have been severely struggling with caring for myself. COVID had just started taking over the world and I found out that my family was moving to a different city... I think both of those things really messed me up. I stopped caring about my diet and gained a bunch of weight (i’m working on losing that weight now which will hopefully improve some things for me), i feel like I don’t have the energy to clean myself and I just feel like shit all the time. In 2019 I was the happiest I’ve ever been… I loved the way I looked, I loved the way I treated myself and how I could do things for myself, I got into an awesome relationship and things were just amazing. Now I can barely step outside my apartment and just stay in bed all day.

I Dont Even Recognize Myself Anymore.,"TW suicide

.In February, I was in a relationship I didn't want to be in anymore, and the smiles were fake. Then I left my husband, and it was hard, then it got easier and I had friends and the smiles turned real. 

In early July I've now lost my best friend's, my roommates, I have my babies staying with a friend because I don't want them to see me like this, I've almost attempted suicide 3 times in the last month, I've lost 50 lbs, spiraled into an eating disorder, turned into a dangerous jaded cynical selfish piece of shit, and I can't even recognize myself apart from pictures from three weeks ago, let alone five months ago.

I almost killed myself Wednsday and it was the closest I ever came to guaranteed death, and I talked myself down, and I regret it? I just disappeared for two days, and I get home yesterday, and my best friend's upset his cat got out the night I disappeared and wasn't back yet? I felt like I was going to puke, and I still feel like my stomach is in my chest. How'd I fuck up so badly my best friend is more upset about his cat being lost a couple days than he was that I'm lost right now?

It feels like I never walked out of the woods. It feels like maybe I did fucking die or whatever part of me that actually wanted to live and not just go through the daily motions and survive is just dead? It feels like I'm watching myself from far away as everything I love crumbles, and it feels like I'm witnessing first hand and that I was right, everyone is better off without me. I'm slipping, and I'm slipping so fast I have nothing to hold onto. It honestly feels like I'm watching as people move on from me being in their lives, and I'm not even dead yet. I'm a ghost to everyone I love, and I'm still fucking alive to see it. 

I tried to go for a drive today, and all my music just reminds me of people I loved that are either dead now, or no longer love me. I can't listen to the music of my childhood without hearing the love of my life strumming along next to me and singing so badly while I sang over him. All our favorite alternative songs that used to be comforting are suffocating me now. All the music from the last few years makes me think of my ex husband and the awkward silences on car rides while the radio played a song I didn't have the energy to sing to anymore. Panic! Makes me think of the drives with the man I loved but never had the right to. Pink! Makes me think of the best friend that never came home to me and died on the way home to me instead. All the newest 200 or so songs make me think of the last few months with the best friendship I've ever known, the most my music taste has been expanded I years, and now every single fucking note makes me want to drive the car into a tree and never feel loss again.

I tried to take a few selfies today. I don't recognize myself. I look haunted, and hollow, and fucking empty. I look fucking soulless. Every single part of me that was me is gone and the last time I felt like this was at my best friend's funeral, staring down at her in the casket and everything in my brain screaming at me to walk away, look away, this isn't her anymore. 

This isn't me anymore. I'm not me anymore. I tried to get help last week. I went to the hospital I come back and everything is worse now. I wanted to kill myself last week, and I got help, and it didn't help. It didn't fix me. Nothing can fix me but everyone wants me to be fixed. I went in Tuesday, got out Saturday, and by Wednesday night I'm sitting in the woods holding razors and sobbing while I tried to think of any reason not to just let go. I found a reason, and I committed myself to really REALLY doing it. No more trying cause that leaves room for failing and I can't right? So I dye my hair my favorite hair color that I've kept it for so long to make myself feel better and more like myself, and it doesn't help. It doesn't feel like me. I get home I clean I take my meds I work I accomplish goals I bring my kids home and I feel so much better and my best friend comes home and I ask him if I'm allowed to just hug him and he says no. He still doesn't forgive me. 

I know they're going through things. I know I can't rely on them they can't pour from an empty cup and I'm fucking PROUD OF HIM for making choices in his life FOR HIM even if I don't agree with those choices. I'm proud of my other best friend and roommate for being so fucking strong and brave while her heart is shattered, but I'm not asking them to pour anything. I'm not asking them to fix me. I'm not asking them to guide me, I'm not asking them to let me lean on them, I just wanted them to stand by my side. I wanted anyone to just stand by my side because I can't save me from myself when the only thing that's kept me going for 11 years now is knowing how badly it would hurt the people I love, and now I know it's not true. It was selfish of me to expect them to care when they have their own shit to handle, but I don't care about me anymore and I just desperately need anyone else to. I just wanted to hang out. Go for a drive, listen to music play a video game do ANYTHING to distract myself from the fact that everything I love is systematically falling apart. I wanted to laugh again with the funniest man I've ever met. I wanted to parent my kids again with the best mom I've ever known. I wanted to clean the house with loud music and dance around with the kids surrounding us and sit at the table and maybe have someone to eat with that makes eating feel like less of a daunting task while I'm losing weight so rapidly my doctors are all concerned for my health and safety. Their other friends hang out, but their other friends aren't a fucking basket case like I am. I'm lonely, and I'm empty, and I'm sad, and I'm dejected, and I'm spiraling and self destructing and it's like I'm watching as everyone I love moves on from my loss while I'm still alive. I'm still right here, I feel like I'm made of glass and it's starting to splinter and pretty soon I'll just shatter completely and that will be the end of it.

Every reason I had to stay is crumbling. My kids deserve a mother that's not broken. My friends deserve a friend that isn't too broken to be around. They don't see the pain and the fear and the glass and the way I've turned into someone I don't know and don't recognize they don't see that I'm fucking pounding on the walls trying desperately to break them down and let someone in before I can't save me from myself anymore they just see the attitude and the rejection they don't see that the isolation isn't what I want or need. I don't want to be not home right now. I don't want to be not with my kids right now. I want to be me again. I want to be home and safe and loved and welcomed and I want someone to find me and see ME and see that I'm still alive and I'm still trying when everything in me doesn't want to anymore I'm giving it a chance I'm giving it a try and I'm failing so fucking badly because I'm doing it alone and it's officially the day I decided I'd kill myself if it didn't get better by July 4th. It's independence day. A day of freedom. The 5 year anniversary of my first suicide attempt. Things aren't better. They're worse. They're so much worse and every single day I wake up with hope and every single day I go to bed crying so hard no sound comes out.

Covid ruined this part of my life,"This mostly venting lol

So when covid started to get serious (March 2020) I had so many plans. First of all I was going to go on a robotics competition at MIT, which was just a huge experience I would’ve love to have. Covid got this cancelled.

Next was my high school graduation, which has been postponed again and again (now it’s gonna be in December 2021 when it was supposed to take place on July 2020).

In summer I hit rock bottom, I was a candidate for a 70% scholarship for college, the final step was to attend a national bootcamp which was gonna be on another city with people from all over the country. Well, the event was online which fucking sucked since my home is not the most peaceful place. This caused many problems while being in zoom and of course I fucked up everything and got denied the scholarship. This actually got me depressed a lot, I stopped eating and getting out of bed was so difficult. 

Fast forward to august 2020, I started my first semester at college, spoiler alert, it fucking sucked. Everything was fucking online, I learned shit.

Fast forward now to January 2021, the whole fucking semester is also online, plus I haven’t met anyone from my classes because making friends via zoom is fucking imposible.

Now it’s summer 2021 and I am losing my shit, I keep telling my self this will end, but holy shit, I’ve spent 1/4 of college locked in my fucking apartment and I just like life is passing by and I am loosing so many experiences. Everyone always says that college is the best stage of their life and I am everyday sitting in front of my fucking computer learning shit, without friends and doing nothing.

How am I supposed to deal with this? Life feels tasteless. I am open for advice. Help

No reason for living just passing time,"I’ve lived a very privileged life in that there hasn’t been any excruciatingly painful periods or situations that are objectively bad. I experience some ordinary troubles of life (e.g. school stress, job hunt anxiety, relationship worries) but overall my life has been pretty mundane. I don’t particularly enjoy any activity. The things I do in my free time like play games, watch tv, reading are just to pass the time until the next day when I have to work or go to class. Even when I hang out with other people or do social activities, I’m waiting for the moment when I can leave. I’m living just to get to the next big goalpost in life (e.g. graduate, get a job, get a family, etc etc). But what’s the point once I get there? I feel like all there is to living is just years and years of waiting until the end. If I were to die today, I wouldn’t really care. The only reason to keep on living is how much it would affect my family if I died. Otherwise, I don’t have much reason to be alive. But then again I don’t have any reason to kill myself either.

"Need to vent, hoping it will help","Been on antidepressants for about 3 years and just the way this week went/I drank a bunch I ended up going 3-4 days without taking them.  Realized it yesterday and thought ""hey maybe I can get by without them I'm feeling pretty good.""

Big reason why I got into antidepressants and therapy was because of the way I view my wife and our long history. Long story but I've had trust issues (both legitimate and unfounded) and for some strange reason tonight is the night she plans to go out with an old high school girlfriend and is staying out later than I expected and I'm not sure if it's all planned and she tells me they ran into an old flame of her friends which can very well lead to trouble...

Both 37, married 10 years, things have been great lately, like best ever, but what are the odds that I fall off my meds for a few days and then this springs up and the emotions flood in.

Just a weird coincidence? It's almost making me laugh like how can this happen. Now I'm running through the day thinking she was acting weird and now I'm thinking it was some scheme that's been planned but I also have been through therapy and know not to trust these crazy feelings and to keep myself calm.

Head shaking, heart pounding, nerves twitching like why now... wanting to laugh, scream, cry...

However all I’d like to do is disappear be gone from where I’m know and go on to start a new life where nobody knows or has perceptions of me.

I’ve messed up things more than people realize due to inaction, being a coward or simply not being smart enough.

I can't tell my therapist what is actually going on inside my head.,"I am a student. My school offers therapy, and I am enrolled in it. The policy at my school regarding therapy is (Roughly); ""If the student speaks of harming himself/others, the parents/guardians must be notified"". This basically fucks me over. I think of killing myself almost every day, and it causes me a lot of pain. I can't even speak a word to my therapist about this, because she will notify my parents, and then I'll get my ass beat. This (obviously) makes things worse for me. My family just goes on thinking that my suicidal thoughts are over and that I'm a perfect kid now, and my therapist just keeps on spouting bullshit.

I feel selfish for being depressed.,"Hi,
I’m 30, have a great paying job, amazing friends and family, the best partner I could ask for, single handedly set myself up for the rest of my life though hard work and had no traumatic or disruptive upbringing to speak of. Yet depression and anxiety continue to get the better of me.

The most depressing case of undiscovered depression,"At the beginning, I haven't seen professionalist yet. I tried once the school psychologist, but she didn't want to listen about my worries that I have depression. She helped me with my father and I don't listen that buying a bottle of water for me isn't worth and it's too expensive anymore, so she at least helped me in some sphere.

I have been simping girls since I was 6. I haven't been in serious relationship and I haven't had sex so far. Since I remember I used to have 1 friend, no more than just 1, who was often changing. When I turned 14, it was more difficult to me, so I kept looking desperately for anybody. At this moment, I have one friend who ""survived"" with me surprisingly long, because more than a year is a shock! For 5 years I can count on 1 hand amount of people with who I talk regularly even on chat. I don't go out more often than twice a month with this one friend, because I have no one else to see. It makes me lonely, and it made me addicted to ma******te. 

I resigned from all kinds of parties, because whenever I try to go for it, it's a disaster! School parties, parties in houses or in clubs, birthdays or anything else, it's always worse than i can even imagine. Last time I ran out crying to my car and I was sitting in there for 30 minutes after 20 min preparing for coming back there from the same car. I was scared and tired, I was so stressed that I vomit immediately everything I tried to eat, so I just drank water. I also completely resigned from drinking alcohol, in 2021 I am 100% clear. Since my 18th birthday (January 2020) I drank max. 10 beers up to August 2020. I used to be stood over by a lot of people on different levels of my education by age-mates. I was called ""fa**ot"", even by my father. I'd like to mention here that I always was straight. I keep social distanced, because I can't deal with people. I am boring and can't make anybody feel safe because I am weak physically and emotionally. I am lanky but useless. I have good grades, but I'm stupid.

I am retarded on relationships sphere, but I'm not dangerous or aggressive. I am werid and panic a lot. I want to cry in situations when there are a lot of people around me, like in theater. Because of that I'd love to move to introvertial Japan, but I'll come back to that later. I don't have any useful knowledge or skills that would let me become independent, so I am also addicted to my parents' will. I do everything so slowly and I don't have any power to live. I sleep 10 hours per day, then I go to my seasonal job, come back home, have 3h to waste and go to sleep again, it has some charm that I like. Tomorrow I'm getting results from exams I was writting at the end of high school, which will tell me if I have any chances to go to university, but I don't have big hopes. I'd like to be journalist or therapist, but I can't deal with myself, so where is dealing with other people?

I live with my parents and grandparents at the same time in the same flat. They are all far religious, so I don't have a choice when it comes to religion. I have to go to church once a week or I'll get punished by for example more practicing and praying. They used to breed me together because my parents work a lot so my grandparents were substituting them. I deal with 2 different types of breeding and I must satisfy them all by being nice and kind and do everything they expect and want from me. I am agnostic, but I must pretend I'm religious too. When I told honestly my father that I don't pray regularly at home, he treated me like air for 3 weeks - didn't talk to me, ignored me etc.

They're pragmatic and conservative so I sometimes treat them like they're dumber than me but they have 1 thing I am jealous of - will to live. I'd love to sleep forever, because I don't want to take responsibility for my life. I'd probably be already dead if I wasn't so scared of death, thanks to their influence. I don't have anybody who could help me with my hell, which I probably made for my own wish. I don't have power to live, people around me don't see life in me, I'm pessimistic and can't find any good feature in me. I am worthless and I get what I deserve.

I find pleasure in fanaticism and obsession. Firstly it were cartoons, then anime, now whole Japan. I am obsessed with it, I'd love to move there but I know that I'm blind and I don't see disadvantages. I have the feeling like only there I can achieve my biggest dream - happiness. I would probably reject every couple offer from local women because I only find Asian girls attractive. I'm more interested in their culture, art, nature, music and more than my local. Maybe I consider it as paradise because it's so far from my actual place of living, my family and more. Sometimes I feel it's achievable, but usually I treat it as dream which is impossible to achieve. 

I am so separated, but I don't feel any privacy out of my phone because of my brother with who I share my room, and we always get the same things. I feel like I were completely average, Grey person, but under tameness.

The worst thing is that I got used to everything of that - not having girlfriend and friends, being addicted and obedient to my family, being weak, dumb and childish, to being ugly and scared of everything. I don't want to change because it's out of my control, I don't want it and probably I wouldn't even have enough power to that. I know s*it and I don't know why I write this. One of my foreign mates from India told me to do that few times this year so I finally did that, but I already consider my life as lost. It all comes to time when I finally die but I don't even know if after death it will be better.

I love watching scars, ravens, blood (especially blooding wounds and eyes) and I tried to write a novel in my native language. I did it and published it so I know I left anything on this world but it won't succeed. I am completely apathic and lazy, and probably any help wouldn't let me live normally now, it's already too bad. It's all my fault and I know about it. Stuff like ""everything's gonna be OK"" or ""you need to take care of yourself and keep fighting"" don't work on me - it's done. Any speciallist haven't told me that I have depression, because I haven't visited any forever and I won't do it soon, because I don't have enough money.

Thank you for listening to me, I don't expect anything else from you now. I don't have hope, will or power to change my life, so it just depends on time when I'll be brave enough to start doing something... to end this. My best friends are funko pops of my favorite band... really, it's comedy, not tragedy.

I wish everyone all the best every time because I know how bad can life be and I don't wish it to anybody so please guys, if you're not that down yet, try!

Why is my appetite just..gone? I haven’t eaten anything today either, it’s six pm. We’re out at a restaurant right now, as I’m writing this.. I’m still not hungry. I want to eat. I want everyday to be normal. I don’t want to have to struggle every damn day at meal times or anytime else. Im tired of it.. I had a dream about M(my moms boyfriend) last night. I was talking to my mom about something (I really can’t remember what) and M interjected saying I needed to do this and that, act like this, say that. You know what I did? I told him to fuck right off! I said “Shut up M, you’re not my dad. I’m NOT going to listen to you.” When I woke up I’m not gonna lie, remembering it made me smile. I think I still have issues that I probably should work out with M. I’m not going to though. Fuck that guy.
So, we finished eating. Why can’t I eat much when I eat? Why am I not feeling hungry, full, anything normal like that? My stomach just feels like a pit, or a black hole. Infinitely empty.

I wish I could love myself,"Or even just care about myself at this point. It’s so hard to see any point in it. Some days I can look in the mirror and be okay, usually I do everything I can to avoid looking at myself. Seeing my own body and face pains me. I don’t want to look like this. I don’t want to exist like this. And even though I do my best to be kind and funny and likable to others (enough so that I have a few close friends) I just… can’t see myself in that same way. I don’t feel worthy of anything. 

I’m tired of laying in bed, hating how I look and feel in my skin, feeling like I’m not worthy of love or kindness, wishing I wasn’t such a waste of space. The worst part is this doesn’t come from anyone else. No one tells me these things but myself. I don’t even have the reason of being bullied when I was in school. I was just… there. Not bullied, not popular. In college it was the same. I’ve never been asked out but people like to talk to me sometimes. I just feel so… mediocre but I hate myself as if I was the scum of the earth. 

I just wish I could at least stand myself so I could try to do things like eat better or lose weight or dress nicer or anything.

I'm scared to tell my friends cuz I don't want them to fall out with me cuz my mood swings are getting pretty bad, i get annoyed at little things, I lashed out at my friend over something so small and we fell out for a bit, I felt horrible.

I feel like my (22F) depression is ruining my relationship with my boyfriend (22M),"I (22F) have depression and anxiety. I've been seeing a therapist since November and have been on anti-depressants since January. However, my anxiety and depression are severely affecting my relationship with my boyfriend (22M) of a year. I'm constantly overanalyzing and overthinking everything, freaking out over every little thing my boyfriend does, constantly checking his social media and see what new girls he has followed and what photos he has liked, worried he'll cheat on me or just get up and leave. I feel like I do super clingy things out of a fear of losing him - and it's all bc of my depression and anxiety. I sometimes consider breaking up with him, but I don't know if that's because he's actually doing things wrong or if I'm overthinking or if I'm actually right. What should I do?

Weird thing about me,"Hi everyone.

I have a weird thing about me and I don't know where to ask about it.

I'm not exactly depressed. I feel excitement about a lot of things, I work out, trying to eat healthier, study, work on my own small project. I would say I am perfectly fulfilled, but I can't feel joy.

More specifically joy when my partner is happy.

I don't know why, she told me that whenever she sees that I am excited about something , she also becomes happy, because I'm happy. 

But for some reason this doesn't work for me, whenever I see her being excited or happy about something, I do not become happy. I'm not sad either. Like my mood doesn't change.  


And when I think about I'm never really happy. I feel positive emotions, like excitement, intrigue, hype  
a lot of positive emotions, but I just cannot really get this happiness thing. What should I do?

I fucking hate everything. I smoke weed everyday to numb my pain until I die... My relationships, no matter how hard I try, always seem to disappoint me in some way... Which is fine and all with friends, but in alot of ways not fine with my romantic relationship. 
I love my SO more than anything, but she hurts me alot with her hyper emotions... She gets too defensive, cannot take any criticism at all. Due to her adhd and PTSD mixed with her anxiety and depression, she can't remember anything. It's really effecting out relationships because we keep arguing over the same thing or she keeps bothering me over the same issue that we can't do anything about several times a day for days on end! 
I hate my family. Brother sexually assaulted my SO then proceeded to put us in 10k with a debt and made us homeless for a year. My oldest sister won't stop having kids, pushes them on to me and tried killing me a few times. The other sister is just a mooching liar and my parents... Well they feel bad for me since they just found out all this since my sibling finally fucking admitted to all of it...

I feel like I literally have to do everything myself. Even killing myself, which I tried and failed. (Fuck never doing that again).

"I am watching the disintegration of everything. Life, society, and the world. A blight consuming everything. I am being devoured inside by everything I see and know.","Kind of disjointed rant, sorry.

Society has been destroyed.  Human beings are ultimately disposable.  Friendships get traded around like an old pokemon card.  Love is a transient affair based on sexuality, economics, or convenience, and not based on mutual interests, love, and meshing.  Our means of socializing in-person has become based in part on algorithmic assignment.  In 15 years dating websites, relationships were gamified and turned into a human casino by Match Group.  Fashion, clothing, and textiles has gone to cheap and disposable, like everything else.  Music has become no only even a chase for the next big hit, but endless pantomime of what came before and only in rare instances do these artists (if they even make their own music to any significant degree) act to CREATE instead of EMULATE.  Movies are endless reboots to capitalize on the lost talents of a bygone era, that or feature juvenile brightly-colored magical people to sell a pantheon to a population kept in neotony.  The human being has become a cookie cutter cardboard cutout of the same video game/anime/music/political cliches.  You meet one person, you met them all.  You can determine political beliefs by haircuts.  Kids barely even make bands anymore let experiment much with music.  The internet in this time, too, has gone from a vibrant series of small quaint tea houses, coffee shops, and boutiques to big box stores like Walmart and, quite literally, Reddit, Amazon, and Facebook.

I cannot survive in this suffocating world where nobody sees the gangrenous blight everywhere.  You cannot talk to anyone because you either already know what they are going to say (the lack of imagination and playfulness everywhere is more than easily visible) and they make their patterns so apparent within their dress and composure.   You cannot give anyone a chance because they are more likely than not going to use you for their own ends; after all, they don't value relationships, they value the cheap thrill of the moment and you're their current fix.  You'll be gone soon.

I wake up in these weird panic terrors at my helplessness because I am one of the very few that see it.  Nobody even shares my interests.  My intellectual interests are for me and me only, and I cannot connect with others on them because they just want to play video games.  We are all segregated by ""save the world"" politics where essentially modern Chalcedonians and Monophysites duke it out over the divine nature of the last guy the cops killed.

Human-fucking-apoptosis.

I just have so many feelings and nowhere to say them. And I don’t want to journal because I don’t want to write my thoughts to myself for me to read later. Who writes with an intended audience of themself only?

I don’t know. I see so many posts in here where people barely respond. It makes me feel lonely still.

I want to tell someone that I suck. That I want to erase my life and wake up and be anyone, ANYONE else. I am too old to be doing this. I’m 25. It’s embarrassing. I’m such a child, so immature. I want to die so badly, but I am scared of the pain, scared of the scars, and scared of going to hell.

I’m a fuck up, a screw up, an instigator, volatile, a bad friend, a selfish person, lazy, a disappointment. I’ve had so many golden opportunities handed to me and I fucked them up. And I don’t want to live life without them. But I destroyed my chances.

If they don’t let me back into school, I might do it. Granted, I might do it now.

The final straw was today. I went for a run and I was almost at the end of it. I had to cross the street.

I fucked up with a girl who cared about me.,"Earlier this year, I met a girl who honestly was good for me. After losing my dog and my job in the same month, when she came along it was like finding the light at the end of the tunnel. We did a lot together for the short time we spent.

I fucked up by saying something I shouldn't have. Even if I didn't think it was all that bad, it still hurt her. I called her soon after to resolve things but it didn't end as well as I thought it would. Then I made the fucking mistake of not contacting her afterwards for 3 weeks. Then I tried to come back like it wasn't serious.

i am not okay but it will get better.,"Hello, little rant here.

I have my ups and downs throughout the week and I’ve been consistently hitting more downs. I know this because I miss my old self, the girl who smiled at everyone and loved doing things to make other people happy. All I seem to do now is get angry at my parents and talk to like 2 people twice a month maybe. I know this isn’t good for me but I want to change because deep down I truly believe there is so much to life that I will experience in the future. I can’t keep shutting out the people i love and pushing my work aside until I “feel better” enough to do it. I hate this mentality and I want to snap out of it. 

I have signed up for therapy (hopefully I get approved) and I want to be my old self, who was happy and social and extremely kind. I’m tired of being worn out and bitchy all the time. I also have a bunch of work to do because I am finishing out my last year of high school so I want to push through and get some motivation to finish strong. But right now, I am drowning and I need to figure out how to get to the shore. I don’t want to drown deeper because I know what it feels like to be submerged under the water. Ive been there before and it sucks- so to everyone who are at that level and want to get better, hi! i am cheering you on. I got out of it and i’m the weakest person i know.

 With that being said, if anyone needs someone to talk to (I’m in my late teens with 0 life experience haha), let’s be friends. :)

My friend is struggling and I dont know what to do,"Hi all. One of my best friends is going through a rough time. 

She told me that she feels like nothing's real sometimes, and recently she had a glimpse of hope. She met someone that would talk to her all day on call and she would feel much better mentally after that.

But she got blocked by him after some things happened (wont go into full detail) and now shes telling me that she hates existing and that everything is so boring.

Trying to get a job and get out of a being a suicidal no-life shut-in neet but I don't see the point,"I've actually been trying to get a job for the first time ever for the past few months to get out of being a complete no-life neet shut-in, with no success so far since everything is terrible due to Covid-19, but still I often think to myself: How is me getting a job going to fix anything?

How is it going to fix all the brainrot warping my perception of reality from sitting at my computer day in day out for almost 10 years now (including the highschool days) because I don't enjoy anything else? How is it going to fix the fact that I've never had any normal, real-life, ""adult"" aspirations or desires or passions and that I don't want to be or do anything? How is it going to get rid of all the scars on my body? How is it going to fix the fact that I'm never able to enjoy any human interaction even when I want to, and that I've never had any friendship that I've legitimately enjoyed or that actually lasted for more than one or two months? How is it going to fix the fact that I've always felt completely alienated from everyone and everything since I was a child?

I guess I just want a job to have independence to buy something every now and then and not owe everything to my parents, as I don't see myself ever being able to go through with suicide since I'm too much of a coward for that even though I want to and I think about it every single day. That's really the only reason. Because job or not, I can't see myself ever being a happy and normal person or ever enjoying being alive.

Last few hours.,"Hey everybody. Long time lurker on this sub. First time poster. I'm planning on killing myself tonight. I think it's about time. I've had maybe 2 or 3 attempts in the past  but this one feels like the one. I'm 30 years old, still live at home with my mum who I love. I work in a call centre. I've been there since March 2017. The past few weeks, I've been drinking at work (working from home an all that because of COVID). I had an episode on Tuesday and just thought to hell with it. I logged off, told my manager I won't be coming back. He's super cool and told me to just take the week off, clear my head, come back Monday and we'll talk. I never replied. The moment I logged off I knew it was time. I can't help but feel I've wasted my life. I look back at myself as a school kid who never paid attention at school, always tried my best to fit in and didn't give a damn about good grades. Boy, was I an idiot back then. It's a shame time travel hasn't been invented yet because I'd go back and give my 13 year old a kick up the ass. I've no friends anymore. I haven't  seem the closest friends I considered dear in my heart since 2018, 3 days before my birthday (one of my attempts). I took a walk around my town today. Walked past the house I grew up in, my old neighbourhood and stomping ground where my childhood friends would hang out. It hit me harder than I thought it would. Seeing those parts of town so different and renovated as to what I remembered them to be was heartbreaking. Things change. That's the way of life. I just don't think I'm ready for change. I think I've ranted enough. Not sure why I'm even posting here. It be cathartic, I dunno. Anyway, I hope whoever reads this finds the strength to go on.

"I am begging you all, if you have depression, consider getting tested for ADHD without hyperactivity (used to be known as just ADD).","I'm an adult woman with ADHD, have always been a space case who couldn't force myself to do things I didn't want to do. Didn't think I could have ADHD because I can focus very well on certain things that I want to like reading novels, whatever. 

Always just thought I was lazy, depressed, tired, lacked willpower and motivation, kindof stupid in common sense ways, etc. Then I heard people talking about ADHD and how it can manifest SO differently from ""hyperactive kid who can't listen"". 

I personally believe they should bring back the two distinct terms of ADD vs ADHD so more people know you don't have to be hyperactive. Now they call it all under ADHD but just say you're not predominantly hyperactive.

Anyway I thought meds wouldn't do anything to improve my life, as far as I knew they just calmed down hyper people so how would that work for me? Then I read about how it can completely change your motivation, make you productive and energetic, etc.

So I got diagnosed, tried medication and the first several did not work at all, they gave me horrible side effects and made me hyper but unfocused and felt like my head was full of bricks and I wanted to gnaw my fingers off. But I wanted to try all the options. 

Anyway long story short, I got on meds that work for me. I still have depression and anxiety but now I have some really good days and can actually be productive. On days where I take my pills and have gotten enough sleep, I can clean, survive the day without taking a random four hour depression nap, and even work on personal hobbies!!

So I'm not perfect but this has GREATLY improved my life and understanding of myself. I have a feeling a lot of people in this forum could benefit from getting an ADHD diagnosis if they fit the criteria.

Growing up, I never actually felt the love when someone said I love you. I never believed in even the holiday fantasies that parents like to do. I remember being 5 years old in my room and thinking I couldn't believe in god. I was never able to trust friends or anyone romantically.

How? When? Maybe things get better maybe they don't - the thing is will I even be alive for that to happen? How much more suffering and disappointment will I have to go through for things to happen?

I am trying. I have been trying all my life. I do not want advice or anyone telling me to try harder bc I've done /am doing that with prescribed meds therapy and through writing.

How will any of this help me get out of debt? How will this help me pay bills? How will this not make me be disabled bc of chronic pain? How can this help me get back into school? How will any of this help me at the very least get out of this abusive household and just living by myself where no one can bother me?

Kind of in awe at the power of depression.,"23F

Clinically, diagnosed depressed (10+ years) , GAD (8 years) , ADHD (15+ years), and Ana B/P (3 years). 

TLDR: I worked pretty hard to stay recovered from my mental illnesses but am now really really bad, have no income and can't face anything.  Nothing is working and I feel hopeless.

I recovered almost completely (other than panic/phobias) for over a year when I was living abroad and met my partner.  

I had to leave as a result of the pandemic and moved back home about 10 months ago. 

I tried SO hard to keep up my healthy habits and my mental state. Right after quarantine, I moved into a new place with a roomate, I started a job within 3 weeks of getting home,  I went to the gym every day until they closed (2nd wave) and I kept eating an adequate amount of food. I barely if ever B/P'd and I tried my best to be social and make friends with my roommate and my colleagues from work. I had hobbies that I pushed myself to pursue, and I tried to keep a good sleep schedule.  

It did work for a while. But as my LDR began to get rough and I started to get overworked working two jobs to save to get back to my partner, things started to go downhill. 

It was super slow, but I started to feel angry and irritated most of the time. I started to obsess about my food intake because I couldn't go to the gym anymore. I started to B/P every week or two instead of every other month. I tried to cut down on work, but it didn't really seem to help. 

Then...  I got covid. 

At first I was just trying to make the best of it and see it as a welcome break. But it messed up my sleep schedule and my energy levels so bad that I got more and more depressed and ate less and less. After I recovered, I wasn't allowed to go back to work because I had long-lasting symptoms like a residual cough, was stuffed up, had lethargy and blood pressure issues etc. This really fueled the fired and I ended up in a full mental breakdown before I knew what was happening.  

I stopped taking my medication, ran away from my apartment for almost two weeks, stopped eating and sleeping. I couldn't face reaching out to the government for EI because for some reason it was so overwhelming that I would have panic attacks or detach from my brain and my body pretty heavily (STRONG depersonalization/derealization). I felt absolutely suicidally depressed one minute, and irrational and manic the next ( I do not have bipolar). I started B/Ping every spare moment I had and began to lose money and weight quickly. 

I eventually tried to get my shit together and went back home. Started my meds again, was luckily able to get into therapy and start an eating disorder program. While I am back to a more stable place in terms of not feeling. absolute extremes, snapping at everyone I know and feeling absolutely claustrophobic like I need to just get out and run away... things still feel like they're getting worse with no end in sight. 

I feel absolutely exhausted all the time. I feel like I'm living in a perpetual dream, and I feel so disconnected from my surroundings all the time and I find it difficult to hold conversations or even bring myself to look people in the eyes or respond to them. Everything just feels like ""nails on. a chalkboard"". Every sound, every stimulus. I feel like I can't bring myself to do almost anything more than get out of bed to go sit on the couch all day instead. Needless to say, I eventually lost my job, and now am making almost no money (thank god for my savings.... which are nearly depleted..) 

I have been back on my meds for a month and a half now and been going to therapy every week, but I just seem to get worse and worse. I don't know how to pull myself out of it. Nothing seems to help and none of what I learned in over 10 years of therapy seems to be getting through. 

Even as I write this, I feel so exhausted I can barely keep my eyes open and I have no drive or desire to do literally anything. 

I just want to feel better. I'm only 23. I have only held a steady job and maintained a happy healthy life for just over 1 year out of those 23. I don't want to be mentally unwell my entire life. I don't know what to do at this point. I feel like I'm working SO hard to do the things I need to do like therapy, medication,  being around my roomate or other people outdoors, trying to keep up SOME amount of my hobbies, getting outside for a walk every day,  trying to keep down at least a few healthy meals a day, journaling, getting enough sleep, meditations, etc etc etc. It didn't save me from the spiral and it's not pulling me out of it.

I think I’m finally broken,"For years I have tried so so hard to beat this. My mental health got better for a few years and now I feel like I am at rock bottom again, but even worse than before. I used to vent too much to friends and I felt alienated and that I overshared, and now I talk to nobody besides my husband and mom which has isolated me further. Then I feel guilty that I don’t appreciate them listening to me. I have so much, so much more than others, and yet I’m so depressed. 

I feel so guilty all the time and I don’t even know what for anymore. The slightest upset lately I start bawling my eyes out and apologizing. For what, I don’t know. I think I deserve to feel terrible. I deserve to lay in bed all day and wish for death. I don’t deserve to go to therapy, because it isn’t working. Nothing is working. Nothing helps. It just gets worse and worse and worse and worse and 

All this said, I won’t kill myself. I know I won’t and I still don’t want to. Through all the pain I know I don’t want to and that I won’t do it. But what do I do to get myself out of this horrible hole. SSRIs sure as hell don’t work. All psychiatrists are terrible. Am I making this all up, is it all in my head? Is it my brain chemistry? Why does this happen why does anyone deserve to feel this way.

I generally hate people,"I hate them because they are stupid, I mean seriously intellectually most people must have an IQ of 100. My cousin and I took an IQ test long ago where he got 145 and I got 140. He is a legitimately really smart guy. He told me the average was 100 and I thought that can't be right. But as I've gone along in life I have realized that is right. Most people are incapable of putting 2 and 2 together. So I am smarter than most of them, I should be happy right? But I'm not, because I am neurotic. First of all, I see the metaphorical disaster that most people are heading towards all the time. I mean like when you watch your grandparent try to operate a DVR or something and you just can't stand it anymore and want to rip the remote out of their hands. Secondly I see the pointlessness in everything because nothing of any value lasts. Like you buy a new car and all I can think about is the day it will be totalled in a wreck, or not run anymore and it's not worth repairing and it heads to the junkyard. I still have psychological scars from seeing our family car from when I was a kid being crushed. My parents are going to die so what's the point? And so on. So I see people who blissfully go through life unaware and i hate them.

I hate people because many of them are bad. They will hurt others to get something for themselves.

There are other reasons I could give.

And I hate people because if you say anything real they just condemn you for not having the same blind world view as they do. Normievision.

i cant take living anymore.,"How do you guys cope? lately the misery of existence is something that i cant shake. I've reached that point of just not wanting to exist anymore. Its tough to justify to people, i have a job as a science teacher so i make okay money, enough to live a relatively comfortable life, i have a loving, supporting mother that i still live with, i have had n traumatic life experiences. I have nothing to complain about according to society.

The reason for my depression is just life in general, we are forced to earn money to live because corporations own our existence. there is no choice, make money or be worthless. as a product,life is quite shitty, i didn't even want it. so as we do with products we don't like/want. i want to return it. and the only way i see to do that is to kill myself. life is such a burden and I don't want it anymore. it is pointless, it is stupid, it is just a waste of time.

can someone please explain to me, why is life supposed to be so precious? can someone please explain why i should feel happy to have this apparent privilege of being alive, it just seems like a lot of bullishit.

My body is a prison on wheels,"I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I have no friends. I only have transient relationships with women because the longer they hang around, the uglier I get. I'd rather the world not see me at all than see me as the piece of shit I see myself. 

I can't control my emotions. I stutter. Every interaction with people feels like a fight or flight scenario. My fucked up brain knows no other way to function. I can fake being a nice person, but I'm evil because of everything that goes on in my head.

No matter where I go, I am stuck with this diseased mind that ceaselessly tortures me. Sometimes, I think of saving up enough money to go on a drug binge to death. Even the time used to gather the money would become a mission with something to look towards. I wouldn't need to appease anyone. I'd finally get to accept myself as the wretched piece of shit I am without remorse or questioning.

My family loves me, but not for me. They love their idea of me, and the second I don't fit that, I get into endless fights with them. If I killed myself, I'd also be killing my parents. I can't afford that. They don't deserve it. They tried their best. I can't torture them for the remainder of their lives. My father always told me a parent dies the day they see their children die.

I may have just screwed up all my friendships. Again.,"I had a great group of people I would get together and hang out and talk with. We would play dnd often. I felt supported and like I belonged. This was all online, long distance, and we all knew each other for over a year.

But last night I left the group. Over the last few months, I had a really bad chronic medical condition flare up. They stopped talking to me most of the time, and started playing a new game that they knew I couldn't join later on, as the themes were too dark for me. As time went on, I felt less and less like I fit in. Too many sexual jokes, new in-jokes I didn't understand, and I was more and more irritable. They still hadn't been talking to me much. In fact, as of last week, it was probably the least I had talked to any of them for the entire time I knew them. Once every few days. Maybe they were trying to give me space or something, but that was the opposite of what I needed.

I didn't feel like I could tell them what was wrong. They had already made so many concessions for me. They couldn't drink around me, because my dad was an abusive alcoholic and I have trauma. They couldn't make strong sexual comments towards one another around me because it made me uncomfortable. I wasn't going to ask them to stop talking about their other game, or tell them that I need more attention. That would be shitty of me. But they always ensured they didn't feel like they were making concessions, that they wanted everyone to feel comfortable. But I know they didn't really feel that way.

Last night I hit the limit. I left the group, and I told two of them in long messages everything that was wrong. One of them was rightfully upset, but both of them told me they understand if I need time to myself. But I think they wouldn't let me back. I know I screwed it all up.

This isn't the first time I've burned bridges. Four times in college and one other time between then and now. I wonder if I'm self destructive. I wonder if I'm not meant to have friends.

Coming to terms,"So I’ve never really posted on here before but could use a listening ear. To begin I’m a 27 year old man who after a lot of reflection have come to terms with the fact that my “dark humor” has actually been a mask for depression. I mean I’ve always kind of figured I was but would just shrug it off like “damn that really sad song about not really wanting to die but thinking about it all the time really hits me, oh well I’m probably just being a baby”. And to some point I still feel that way but with my recent breakup/divorce of my wife of 7 years it’s really taking a toll on me.

Losing Interest,"I'm very certain I'm no longer the person I used to be. I have found it hard to adapt to life's current circumstances and forever let the obsessions of my mind plague the way I think. I'm not longer living in the moment, I can't. Everything is a catastrophe and a blow to my self esteem. Now these are the thoughts on my chest:

I'm twenty three with no friends or social connections, I was extremely isolated as a kid and find it hard to feel connected at all with other people even though I desire to. I work now after being on SSDI for major depressive disorder part time and have been taking cymbalta and other antidepressants for nearly five years along with other medications. I've started taking medicine at the age of 11. I feel forgotten and want to drink myself to death.

I make fun of therapy and therapist and constantly lie to them about myself. I truly don't know how I feel when someone ask me so I have to fake it, I feel like a ghost. I always wanted to go to college, career seek and do my hobbies but my energy levels prohibit it. Why can't I feel I feel interested in anything? How is it possible to tell someone that has  no real value in the world that their life has meaning? How can people acknowledge these issues and other people don't even experience the feeling of being truly disconnected? (therapist or otherwise)

I've always wanted a love life too, I've wanted a girl friend for forever. And now I'm forever resentful. I have to watch life chained to my inner critic. Every stranger looks like someone about to hit me for being an idiot, to hit me until death. I only hear mockery in real voices of these strangers. I know the voices aren't real and subsist in a state of unreality or layer of my mind. I'm not delusional and sometimes wonder why I'm so fucked up.

i havent felt like this in a long time.,"hi, all. 

i have no idea how to properly introduce this post, so im just going to dive right into it. hopefully it isnt too long.

for the past few weeks, i have felt like absolute shit. im currently writing this about twenty minutes after a mental breakdown, which consisted of me sobbing and practically begging for this mental anguish to cease. a few days ago, i had a similar experience, which actually resulted in me falling to the hardwood floor in a fit of tears. these mental breakdowns are completely new to me - ive never been the dramatic type when it comes to handling my emotions, but it feels almost painful to hold these things in. 

im a 17 year old boy who is currently trying extremely hard to recover from an eating disorder and deal with depression at the same time. for a while, everything was looking up for me. i was happy and eating normally again - i truly felt as if i was finally accomplishing something! it was an amazingly freeing feeling. 

i dont know what happened. im now back at square one - every time i pass by a mirror, i almost gag in disgust. i genuinely see myself as the ugliest person on earth, physically and mentally. i hate my face, my voice, my body, my personality, and everything about myself. 

when im not crying, i feel almost detached from everything, like im dreaming or watching a film. i never really socialize with people, aside from immediate family and small groups of friends. i feel so utterly alone. nobody seems to see how much pain im in, nor do they try particularly hard to check up on me personally. 

ive been getting frequent headaches from my crying, and have lost at least ten pounds in the past three months due to my eating habits. my mom has expressed concern for my health, but i absolutely despise the idea of making her worry, so i just cover it up with a smile and convince her that im alright, or that i can handle my hardships without any help. im stubbornly independent in every aspect of my life. 

i dont know what to do anymore. i feel so lost. i havent been in such a deep depressive episode since middle school. i feel unworthy and unloved. 

im not looking for any advice. i just needed to vent somewhere, i suppose. feel free to ignore this. im sorry.",hwaemail,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/od7cqa/i_havent_felt_like_this_in_a_long_time/,hi idea properly introduce post im going dive right hopefully isnt long past week felt like absolute shit im currently writing twenty minute mental breakdown consisted sobbing practically begging mental anguish cease day ago similar experience actually resulted falling hardwood floor fit tear mental breakdown completely new ive never dramatic type come handling emotion feel almost painful hold thing im 17 year old boy currently trying extremely hard recover eating disorder deal depression time everything wa looking wa happy eating normally truly felt wa finally accomplishing something wa amazingly freeing feeling dont know happened im back square one every time pas mirror almost gag disgust genuinely see ugliest person earth physically mentally hate face voice body personality everything im cry feel almost detached everything like im dreaming watching film never really socialize people aside immediate family small group friend feel utterly alone nobody seems see much pain im try particularly hard check personally ive getting frequent headache cry lost least ten pound past three month due eating habit mom ha expressed concern health absolutely despise idea making worry cover smile convince im alright handle hardship without help im stubbornly independent every aspect life dont know anymore feel lost havent deep depressive episode since middle school feel unworthy unloved im looking advice needed vent somewhere suppose feel free ignore im sorry,havent felt like long time,2239,39

Problem of passing time and pointless future,"I highly doubt anyone will read it or pay much attention to it, but since this is the only place I can freely talk about my disorder and causes of it, I decided to give it a try.

Struggling with depression for nearly 2 years now I come to rather unique conclusions that I dont see being mentioned really often (at least in my country). Problem is, that my future(by this I mean adulthood, since I am 18 now) will be an absolute disaster. There is very limited number of workplaces and now more often finished uni doesnt guarantee you a nicely paid, stable job. Also we are an aging society so we either will have no or very small pensions when we get older. Not to even mention all the climate problems that will overwhelm our society pretty soon. That alone makes me feel really bad already.

Secondly, every time I look back into my childhood, I can see how careless I was, how everything was just simpler and easier. Whenever I came across some piece from my past I just get so extremly jealous and anxious I just want to end everything on spot. Or when I think about friends I used to have, it just feels so unfair that the older I am the lonelier I get.

Lastly, my present also is terrible. Everyone says how highschool is best time of their lives, how many amazing people they met and it makes me so furious when I think about my highschool. Half of it we spent alone at home. I got like 1 friend this whole time. Never had someone that loved me. I just feel straight up scammed by all the people that had great time in highschool.

In conclusion, is there any reason to live then? My live changes nothing in others lives and I already hate every part of my live. Is there any hope for things to get better?

"I guess my best friend is depressed, Is there anything I can do to help him?","Idk if this is the right sub for this but I hope to find some answers here. So, in short, I guess my best friend is depressed and I wonder if I can do anything about it.

He's my neighbour and we met in 2016 and then on we became really good friends. I became closer of him and his school friends who are also cool as hell, and I used to go to his house every Saturday to watch movies together, play music, talk and joke around, or go to the mall, anyway, every Saturday we got together to do something. Since the pandemic started I've noticed that the frequency we hanged out has dropped a lot. I went there every Saturday, then after a while about twice a month, then just once a month, and now it's been almost 3 months since I call him every Saturday and we've never done anything together again. 

I have a hard time understanding people's feelings, so at the time I thought ""Wow, he's really trying to avoid me?"" and I was pissed because I like doing things with him so much and then out of the blue we just never did anything, but then I talked to my parents (they had depression) and they explained it better to me that he was actually depressive. I talked to his friends and they told me some info too.

I'll do a little list of what happened:

\- Before all of this, he always used to sleep and wake up very late. He usually sleeps around 4am and wakes up around 4pm), but he'd still join our discord calls to play and talk to us all the time. Now even though he sleeps/wakes up at the same time, he almost never join our discord calls again.

\- About him ""never"" joining us to play, it's not like he never ever join our calls anymore. I mean, he join us sometimes, but the frequency has dropped a LOT, he used to be online like, 5 out of 7 days a week, now he's only 1 if we're on a lucky day.

\- Her friends told me he's acting kinda ""whatever-ish"" with everything basically. They told me they've had a lot of school homework that they needed him to show up but he actually never showed up. He even replied in the groups with ""Fine, 7 o'clock I'll be online so we can do the homework"", but when the clock hit 7 he wouldn't appear. Just hours and hours later he'd just read and not reply the messages of people calling him or he'd just tell an excuse like ""Oh sorry, I was sleeping"". Their friends told me it's always like he ends up missing the time, and when he sees that it's been like 10 minutes that they already started a meeting, he's like ""I'm already late soo it's not even worth joining in""

\- Now at pandemic he basically only sleeps and watch movies, literally. I mean, Ofc we already hanged out on real life together and stuff, but when we call him to play or to hang out to the mall, or idk, do anything really, he just ghost us, either reading the messages inviting him to do something and never replying, or just not seeing them at ALL.

\- He vanishes for long hours and we don't have a clue why. He don't explain us what's happening, how is he feeling, if he actually wanna do something or not, he just read our messages and that's all, he vanishes. Never reply us with words.

\- I actually talked to our housekeeper maid (which is the same as his, she works in both houses) and she said she found anti-depressant pills and meds and all that stuff in the trash bin. 

\- The worst part is that his family doesn't help. His parents are divorced since he was born, but they're neighbours. His father is a doctor that's always out and his mom is a teacher. The fact is, at the free time even his mom always used to sleep and just wake up to play their piano and eat and then sleep again. Not because they're depressed too, but their parents just, idk, don't seem to care for him. If he doesn't shower they won't even bother asking him ""What's that smell?"". If he sleeps all day long, they don't bother saying ""Hey, you're only 15, you can't sleep all day long"". They don't bother with nothing, absolutelly nothing, they let him on his own, their parents just wake up to cook food and that's ALL, all they do is sleep. They probably don't even know he's depressed since they only sleep all day long...

\- I told all this to my parents and I decided to call him myself. One day I told him I had written a new song and asked him if he wanted to take a look. After long hours waiting, he replied 11:00pm ""Oh hey, Alright, but I'll be online just a little time today"". When he joined discord with me I asked him what was happening. He was pretty open, he told me he was using pills and meds and he was feeling kinda uninterested, he cried all the time and was feeling bad about something he couldn't tell what it was. He said he was very down because of the pandemic and school giving lots of homework and exams for them and stuff and told me actually lots of people around him are asking every day ""Is everything fine dude?"", and he said he felt better last week but now I can see It's getting worse again.

I mean, my parents had depression so I asked them what could I do, and my parents said ""Try calling him more often to go out and do things with you, ask him to go to the mall or ride your bycicles, and if he says he doesn't want to, force him by saying ""No, come on, complain after we did it"". Because if you give him the choice he'll never leave his house on his own, so pressure him to hang out with you.""

But Idk if that's the right way, and yet every single time I tried ask him to hang out or to play or do anything we used to, he won't even read my texts, he simply vanishes for long hours and don't even bother interacting with me or his friends. What can I do to help? I don't wanna see my friend this way, but how can anyone help him if he just vanishes and sleeps and... you know? I'm lost here, I wanna help him not getting worse but how? :(

TLDR: My friend is probably depressed. He only sleeps and wakes up to watch movies, vanishes for long hours and never replies to me and our friends messages. We hang out sometimes and he joins discord to play with us sometimes, but the frequency is getting always down and we're getting worried since he was never like that.",LoveLouReed,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/odc6ov/i_guess_my_best_friend_is_depressed_is_there/,idk right sub hope find answer short guess best friend depressed wonder anything neighbour met 2016 became really good friend became closer school friend also cool hell used go house every saturday watch movie together play music talk joke around go mall anyway every saturday got together something since pandemic started noticed frequency hanged ha dropped lot went every saturday twice month month almost 3 month since call every saturday never done anything together hard time understanding people feeling time thought wow really trying avoid wa pissed like thing much blue never anything talked parent depression explained better wa actually depressive talked friend told info little list happened always used sleep wake late usually sleep around 4am wake around 4pm still join discord call play talk u time even though sleep wake time almost never join discord call never joining u play like never ever join call anymore mean join u sometimes frequency ha dropped lot used online like 5 7 day week 1 lucky day friend told acting kinda whatever ish everything basically told lot school homework needed show actually never showed even replied group fine 7 clock online homework clock hit 7 appear hour hour later read reply message people calling tell excuse like oh sorry wa sleeping friend told always like end missing time see like 10 minute already started meeting like already late soo even worth joining pandemic basically sleep watch movie literally mean ofc already hanged real life together stuff call play hang mall idk anything really ghost u either reading message inviting something never replying seeing vanishes long hour clue explain u happening feeling actually wanna something read message vanishes never reply u word actually talked housekeeper maid work house said found anti depressant pill med stuff trash bin worst part family help parent divorced since wa born neighbour father doctor always mom teacher fact free time even mom always used sleep wake play piano eat sleep depressed parent idk seem care shower even bother asking smell sleep day long bother saying hey 15 sleep day long bother nothing absolutelly nothing let parent wake cook food sleep probably even know depressed since sleep day long told parent decided call one day told written new song asked wanted take look long hour waiting replied 11 00pm oh hey alright online little time today joined discord asked wa happening wa pretty open told wa using pill med wa feeling kinda uninterested cried time wa feeling bad something tell wa said wa pandemic school giving lot homework exam stuff told actually lot people around asking every day everything fine dude said felt better last week see getting worse mean parent depression asked could parent said try calling often go thing ask go mall ride bycicles say want force saying come complain give choice never leave house pressure hang idk right way yet every single time tried ask hang play anything used even read text simply vanishes long hour even bother interacting friend help wanna see friend way anyone help vanishes sleep know lost wanna help getting worse tldr friend probably depressed sleep wake watch movie vanishes long hour never reply friend message hang sometimes join discord play u sometimes frequency getting always getting worried since wa never like,guess best friend depressed anything help,6114,76

A New Threshold of Depression: I'm Too Disconnected to Be Sad,"I think I have reached a new threshold of depression. I am so far gone, so separated from reality, that I have two states of mind: short-lived joys, and rational calmness. 

Let's start with short-lived joys. For me, I am in this state of mind as often as any healthy person, whether it be looking at memes, videos, movies, etc. or laughing and conversing with friends and colleagues. It's genuine joy, but when I say that it is short lived, I simply mean that it only lasts while in the moment and I will ultimately feel unfulfilled again. Joy is great, of course, but if I had to choose between joy and contentment/fulfillment, I'd pick the latter nine times out of ten. 

The second state of mind is, in actuality, much sadder than than its name makes it out to be: calmness. I have reached a level of hopeless that literally give me solace in the fact that I don't have to concern myself with hoping my circumstances change at some point. I don't think I have completely lost hope, yet, and I'll get to that in a second. But I have lost so much hope that I no longer feel sad or cry anymore. I don't think I'm ever going to find true love, let alone find a girlfriend. I've also accepted that I am not a person that can create intrinsic motivation from nothing, and therefore will never amount to greatness. I just don't have the willpower or drive. A byproduct of so much lost hope is I don't have passion. For anything. Not ideologies, political beliefs, activities, hobbies, anyone, anything. The calmness has left my mind so hollowed that passion seems completely unattainable. 

I don't think I've lost all hope yet. I kinda wish that I would because maybe then I'd kill myself or at least not have it lingering in the back of my mind to gnaw at me. But there's so little that I shouldn't complain about it. It's just like a little mosquito bite that itches sometimes. 

I just wrote this because I like being able to put my thoughts into words, and maybe there are some others out there that are so sad that they aren't sad.",sean_zucchini,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/od4fe0/a_new_threshold_of_depression_im_too_disconnected/,think reached new threshold depression far gone separated reality two state mind short lived joy rational calmness let start short lived joy state mind often healthy person whether looking meme video movie etc laughing conversing friend colleague genuine joy say short lived simply mean last moment ultimately feel unfulfilled joy great course choose joy contentment fulfillment pick latter nine time ten second state mind actuality much sadder name make calmness reached level hopeless literally give solace fact concern hoping circumstance change point think completely lost hope yet get second lost much hope longer feel sad cry anymore think ever going find true love let alone find girlfriend also accepted person create intrinsic motivation nothing therefore never amount greatness willpower drive byproduct much lost hope passion anything ideology political belief activity hobby anyone anything calmness ha left mind hollowed passion seems completely unattainable think lost hope yet kinda wish would maybe kill least lingering back mind gnaw little complain like little mosquito bite itch sometimes wrote like able put thought word maybe others sad sad,new threshold depression disconnected sad,2034,61

I have no black friends as a black person living in a predominately white area and it’s contributing to my depression.,"I went on vsco this evening. If you don’t know, vsco is the app where girls (mostly white that I’ve seen) casually and aesthetically post about their trips and hang outs. I knew it’d make me sad because I have no friends myself. But man, white girls who go to predominately white schools seem to have it so easy when it comes to friends. Then I realized that I have no friends of my race. 

The only time I had black friends was when I was on twitter; all of my mutuals were black but my depression made me eventually leave the app and community. I wish I could just have close friends that look like me in real life. I daydream of a reality like that. I don’t want to be like “race 100 % matters” but it’d be so much easier for me to have friends that understand me; my race, my culture, and the depression I have because of it. Any other friendship wouldn’t feel real. 

My schools black student body is 2.4 %. I feel so alone. My only black friends are my older brothers. And even then they’re never home. I barely even leave my house.

Worrying about a friend,"Recently a good friend of mine decided he wanted a break from talking because his mental health was getting bad and he wanted to fix it. He said it wasn't my fault, and I hope it wasn't, however beside all that I'm very worried about him. I understand he needs time and space, but I'm left with no idea about how long it could be until we can talk again.

TW: mention of self-harm, or worse
I'm an overthinker (with depression, anxiety, and ocd), so my mind is going 100mph everytime I think about it. And if mental health has anything to do with it, then I'm always worrying about potential self harm or worse. I've had more than my fair share of it all, so I'm always cautious.

Well. This has been part of my life for over a week now. I really hope I am simply overthinking. I know he is going through a lot. 

I have no clue how to know if he's okay or not. I've been talking with him every day for a year, and now we haven't talked at all in almost two weeks, so it's a big adjustment. Which I'm sure may be even harder for him, considering what's going on.  

I am seeing a therapist right now, but I've found that putting my worries out into the world (or just the internet) is sometimes a useful way for me to let go of them.",bunforpresident,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/odb689/worrying_about_a_friend/,recently good friend mine decided wanted break talking mental health wa getting bad wanted fix said fault hope however beside worried understand need time space left idea long could talk tw mention self harm worse overthinker depression anxiety ocd mind going 100mph everytime think mental health ha anything always worrying potential self harm worse fair share always cautious well ha part life week really hope simply overthinking know going lot clue know okay talking every day year talked almost two week big adjustment sure may even harder considering going seeing therapist right found putting worry world internet sometimes useful way let go,worrying friend,1233,23

Driven away the only person who can help me.,"I'm feeling so lost right now. I've been in period of severe depression for a while now, worse than I've ever had before (35, lived with depression and mental health issues all my life). Initially this latest depression was caused by heartbreak, after spending time with a friend who I'd fallen for I'd decided to finally tell her how I felt the next time we met (first time in my life I'd felt that way and was ready to confess), however just before that happened I found out she'd just started seeing someone else. That sent me into a terrible state of depression and neglect for self care, as well as over reliance/abuse of alcohol to try and cope. 

One night I reached out to my closest friend, however I wasn't thinking clearly, was still in a broken state mentally, and was heavily under the effect of alcohol, so in the course of that conversation I was in tears, not making sense, and seemingly saying 'goodbye' to my friend as I said I'd made the choice to dissappear. This conversation scared my friend, and she was worried what I might do to myself, it was also quite late at night and out of the blue, so this was also a lot for her to take. The result is I ended up scaring my friend, upsetting her, hurting her (emotionally), and pushing her away. I've tried a couple of times to apologise to her and have asked if I can have a chance to make things up to her, initially she seemed to forgive me and it looked like things were going to be ok, but the last few weeks it's become clear that isn't the case, and I'm not longer part of her life. She's shut me out and from what I can gather from a mutual friend, I've lost her for good.

That has actually ended up breaking me and sending me into a further depression and point which I feel I can't come back from. The heartbreak I was suffering from initially doesn't seem to matter anymore in comparison to this. I know this might sound silly, but I'm 35,and this small group of friends who I met these last few years are the only friends I've ever had. Out of them this friend who has shut me out now has been my closest friend and the most important person I've ever had in my life! I can't describe everything and all the reasons why, but she's been such a big part of my life, always supportive, caring, and fun to be around, her energy and positivity lit up my life. I don't know how to go on now, I feel there's almost no point in me trying to get myself back to normal because there is no normal without her in my life. If I've lost her as a friend then it feels like my life is over and a large part of me has died. I know some people will just say 'get over it, make other friends', but that isn't how it works! I can't get over it, I don't want to make other friends, she is irreplaceable and will always be in my heart. Losing my friendship with her is it for me, I can't bare the thought of life without her as my friend.

So I'm in a position where the only thing that will help me and can get me out of this depression is if my friend ends up forgiving me and restoring our friendship, but she's shut me out of her life, so I'm forever stuck in this hell. I can't blame anyone other than myself as it was my state that drove her away, and I understand things from her point of view, it's her choice if she doesn't see me as a friend anymore. I've tried seeking professional help, and even started therapy, but none of that has helped/is helping, as my depression now is coming from losing the best friend I've ever had. And no amount of medication or therapy can fix that situation, only she can if she decides to forgive me, which of course she may choose not to. 

So I've lost the only person who can save me. She's the one person in the world who can make everything better and make my life go back to normal, but I've scared her away from my actions that night and I don't know what more I can do.

Why do I feel like I have to physically hurt myself to feel better?,"Had a really bad argument with my mom today. I was so angry, I wanted to shout and yell at her and tell her all the bad things she did to me, how much the things she says hurt me. 

I believe there so much repressed trauma and our occasionally arguments trigger it and I cannot contain the distress it causes. After these episodes, I cry and cry for hours and I need to physically hurt myself because I cannot bear the pain in my chest. 

Today, for example I scratched my arms and legs. To be fair I wanted to cut them so badly. I used to cut my thights when I was 15. And sometimes I just want to cut myself so deeply until I cannot feel anything. The strange thing is that after I see the bruises I feel relief, it brings me comfort. 

The same thing goes with starving. Sometimes I wonder if I starve to ""look better"" or to hurt myself,  because I ""deserve"" it.

Wow. I really hate being lonely,"So I’m stuck in bed for 2+ weeks due to surgery on my thigh. Currently on day 3 of 5 of not being allowed to drive post-op and won’t see any of my co workers for possibly 20 days because my work is extremely labor intensive and I usually put in at least 4 days of the week being 10 hour work shift and my doctor told me that is a big no-no while I’m recovering.

Had my surgery Wednesday and oh my God I’m losing my mind. I hate this. I hate being confined like this. I’m so lonely and I hate it. I’m even texting random family members I haven’t spoken to in months in hopes of them responding back just to have someone to talk to. To make matters worse my neighbors seem to be having some sort of awesome pool party and with a bunch of people and I just wish that was me hanging with friends or someone or ANYTHING.

I also hate this because when I’m alone and bored out of my skull like this I start to get really really depressed about my life and how I feel like a total fuck up. I don’t consider myself successful by any means. I really thought I’d be married by this age (24) and I haven’t even gotten an SO yet nor have the house of my dreams. I taught myself how to crochet but even that’s getting old. And video games are barely holding my focus.

It’s funny cuz I’d been overworking myself so bad these last couple months and the burnout was really starting to get to me. Like to the point where I wanted to cry every single day, and I was so relieved to have gotten medical leave for 2 whole weeks to do nothing and just relax for once. But now I see it more as a curse. I guess because in a way I’m handicapped and can’t move from one spot too often or my sutures will pop.

Finding purpose in the void of a life,"Hello everyone, so this is my first post in reddit, I have been creeping out here for a long time but now I need help more than ever in this specific matter. So Iam 23 years old right now and Iam really not sure if this happened only to me (probably not) or if it is a common thing in here, but I have been depressed for as long as I can remember and I don't have any suicidal ideation but I have always dreamed for things to just.. end
The two main problems that have always haunted me is
1)How purposeless life is and 2)how lonely I always feel

As for the first point, it is really too hard to discuss this point thoroughly, but to sum up my point I went through all religions (the ones that I know off atleast) and I really followed the one that gave me most satisfaction, don't want to go in details regarding religion but yeah it gave me an ultimate goal which most religions follow in a way. Which is giving a moral compass to the people (an obvious point.. duh, but the details in religion are more satisfactory)
Following the first point, I chose a career that I found quite challenging and rewarding, medicine (specifically surgery). I chose this career to help as much as I can and trying to satisfy my hunger of purpose by getting this recognition (spoiler it still didn't do the trick)
I tried to do many things more like hobbies and working out, but here is the problem...
I STILL lack purpose and satisfaction in my life
And I always feel this endless void consuming me from within and I really don't know how to quinch 

As for the second thought and the my own nightmare, loneliness...
I really am blessed in this life with many things. Health, good friends and family.. but I still ALWAYS look so lonely that I can't bare the idea of my existence! And as I mentioned I DO have a good loving family and few but really faithfull and fun friends but that did not help at all, but the exact opposite because if they were the reason in any way then that would have been my escape or a justified reason for this feeling

So everyone... what... what can I do?
Knowing that I also started taking anti-depressant for 3 months, it helped with the symptoms but not the origin

I’ve been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts since I was 16. I have a lot of friends and support in my life but just feel like I amount to nothing. I just quit my job 1 month ago which I felt was a step Im the right direction but I’ve done nothing to improve my life yet. I struggle to form romantic relationships and haven’t been in one since I was 17. I was told by one of my gay friends tonight that I could pull any girl I wanted if I just had confidence. But there’s the problem, my anxiety has been rapidly increasing over the last year and I’m struggling to talk to anybody now, even some of my closest friends. I’ve been on several dates in the last year but all of them have just ended in panic attacks and I’ve kind of given up at this point. I have never talked to anybody about my struggles with my mental health because I don’t want to put my burden on them. I even recently helped my best friend seek out therapy for his turbulent childhood upbringing but I can’t even find the courage to seek therapy myself. I feel like I’m just throwing my life away and if I continue down this path suicide is probably in my future. I just had a friend I’ve known since first grade commit suicide last week and when I went to his funeral two days ago all I could think about was that I don’t blame him for leaving his friends and family behind because I understand how it feels. I feel like life is just passing me by but I’m too lazy to do anything about it, my friends are getting married, my sister is starting her career, friends are moving away and I’m still at the same spot as when I was 17.

Tired,"I am tired of everything.

I feel empty and purposeless. And I feel guilty because I have some things that not every one can have.

I have a great internship job and I'm finishing up college with excellent grades, I have friends, family and a fianceé who loves me.

This world and society we developed is just insanely unfair, people are damn selfish. We can see more clearly this selfishness in people who break quarantine partying while almost 4.000.000 deaths over the world.

The weekend is my escape and relief, because I can take some pills and sleep all day and avoid feeling anxious. I think the moment I feel happier is when I'm asleep.

I have this feeling that I am okay now, but anytime all will fall apart and I will commit suicide. I just don't do it because I think about everyone that I would hurt if I did that.

So... I continue suffering for them.

Deeply, I just want something to believe, because I feel life is purposeless. Is the same destiny for all of us, it doesn't matter if I was successful in the patterns of society.
We will die and every single person you loved, every single memory of good will be forgotten and.. that's it.

I feel like I don't deserve anything and I'm a terrible person.,"I'm struggling to write this so bear with me. 

When I was a dumb horny teenager (14-15) I made a very stupid decision and ended up hurting someone. I don't want to say exactly what I did because it disgusts me and it would disgust you too. 

For some years I felt no remorse at all, I even fantisized about it. But as I got older I realized just how terrible what I did was. No one knows about what I did, but just having it in my conscience is unbearable, it's like when I talk to someone they can tell I'm a bad person. I stopped talking to my friends, I stopped going outside, I stopped taking care of myself, I pretty much cut myself off from society... Sometimes I drink and do drugs to try to forget about it... and I have suicidal thoughts very often.

And I feel like I deserve being miserable, why should I enjoy my life if I'm such a shitty person? I don't know why I'm writing this, this subreddit is for people looking for help, but I don't know if I even want any.

"I’ve been struggling, Im aware if it, but I don’t know how to get better","Im 21, I’ve been diagnosed with severe depression and bpd in 2019/2020 but I’ve never really got it treated properly, it kinda accelerated due to covid. I’ve been through the average rough childhood with separated parents, neglect, bullied, physical + emotional abuse, r/pe, miscarriages/ abortion, and pretty much every horrible shit u can think of but idk, im not looking for sympathy or comfort. I feel like I’ve accepted that my life has been shit and I’ve attempted multiple times and ended up in the ER. I convince myself im fine, that all this is made up and all in my head, im the problem and everything i need to know, everything i need to hear to get through can be found on the internet. I tried therapy, 3 different counsellors, 4 different psychs, so many different types of medication but nothing worked and so i gave up on them. Im still sad, i still cant shake this feeling off even though im so aware of it. No amount of “things will get better” will help me through it. On the outside i keep it together, full scholarship student, 3.8 cgpa, has cats, has a roof over my head and still have good meals. It makes me feel ungrateful for what i have when people are literally dying or are less fortunate. I think about dying everyday, but i cant leave behind my cats… they’re the only reason i get up each morning now. Im fully aware im not well, im fully aware that i cant live like this… but i just can’t move on with my life, i cant justify it.

The truth about regret. (Story),"This is a poem / story that i translated from french, that is probably not as good as it sounded to me. 
Idk if this is the right place to share it, but i felt like this is kinda depressing. 

""Man never ceases to regret, that is why in sleep he can find a rest that only death could guarantee him.  The sad man, you will notice, always try to do the least, and to sleep as long as possible: every moment in the world of dreams is a moment spent far away from this bitter reality that he seeks to avoid.  So what if our dreams took us away, took possession of us?  We and all of our repressed wishes and regrets, suddenly we would go mad and, or suicidal.
 So what about those who start from a nightmare and join a much worse one?
 In this room there is only him, him and his memories, him and his regrets, him and these numerous obsessive neurosis.  What about the nightmares he just had?  Is he in reality or in another one of those allucinations that his corrupt brain forces him to look at?
 His gaze falls everywhere on the walls of these narrow walls.  Watery eyes watch him, yet that's not what scares him.  Not in reality what he fears is the possibility that he has just woken up.
 Then he comes into contact with those eyes which remind him of painful memories.  Then suddenly an eye falls.  He picks it up with difficulty, having difficulty in appreciating the distances.  After having observed it for a long time, he swallows the eye as a test.  He smells the taste beautiful and well in one eye, he is disgusted by it, vomiting his disgust, he is surprised to have forgotten the taste.
 When he leaves the room he finds only mirrors, thinking, he loses his memory and wonders what he was doing here.
 In a burst of shame he hides his eyes so as not to see the reflections of these bloody mirrors.
 When after 12 minutes he removed the cover in front of his eyes.  He observed that he was in an alley.  The alcohol must have given him all these visions he thought, so he stood up, though staggering, and walked to where his body wanted to take him.
 Suddenly the rain began to fall, reminding him of a scene he wanted to forget.  Suddenly, two men pass in the narrow aisle, one holding a doll in his hands, and the other a ruddy bag.
 It was too much, he had to hide, the evil had no face other than his own, and knowing it hurt like hell, his heart twisted in his rib cage.
 Why now ?  Why in front of him?  He has been fleeing this past for 3 years.  So as usual he turned his head and closed his eyes, hearing only the sound of cries of women and children.  Then at the end of this cacophony, he heard the noise of plastic that crashes on the ground, as well as that of cooking.
 Praying to die he opened his eyes, seeing himself in a white room, empty of all feeling.  His eyes close slowly, permanently.  His last memory will be confused, what did he see?  What is the reality?  Anyway, he doesn't have to worry about it, because he knows that when his eyes are definitively closed, he returned to hell.""",Hazraam,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/od2d6y/the_truth_about_regret_story/,poem story translated french probably good sounded idk right place share felt like kinda depressing man never cease regret sleep find rest death could guarantee sad man notice always try least sleep long possible every moment world dream moment spent far away bitter reality seek avoid dream took u away took possession u repressed wish regret suddenly would go mad suicidal start nightmare join much worse one room memory regret numerous obsessive neurosis nightmare reality another one allucinations corrupt brain force look gaze fall everywhere wall narrow wall watery eye watch yet scare reality fear possibility ha woken come contact eye remind painful memory suddenly eye fall pick difficulty difficulty appreciating distance observed long time swallow eye test smell taste beautiful well one eye disgusted vomiting disgust surprised forgotten taste leaf room find mirror thinking loses memory wonder wa burst shame hide eye see reflection bloody mirror 12 minute removed cover front eye observed wa alley alcohol must given vision thought stood though staggering walked body wanted take suddenly rain began fall reminding scene wanted forget suddenly two men pas narrow aisle one holding doll hand ruddy bag wa much hide evil face knowing hurt like hell heart twisted rib cage front ha fleeing past 3 year usual turned head closed eye hearing sound cry woman child end cacophony heard noise plastic crash ground well cooking praying die opened eye seeing white room empty feeling eye close slowly permanently last memory confused see reality anyway worry know eye definitively closed returned hell,truth regret story,3021,31
Sick for so long,"I've been in mental health treatment for 17 years now. I recently came off all my meds and  stopped seeing doctors.

I'm also struggling with porn addiction which complicates things but honestly with where I'm  at is probably the least of  my  worries.

Struggling with life right now,"Here's the thing. I've suffered with depression for many many years. I'm on medication (citalopram) and the majority of the time it's managed really well. Occasionally I have an odd day where I'm tearful but it usually resolves within a day.

Over the past month or so I've just felt so overwhelmed. All I want to do is curl up in a ball and sleep but I know I can't. 

A few things have made me feel worse recently I reckon. My bf and I were moving home, so that's stressful and then my period was a week late which never happens. Thankfully it eventually came. Also work had been a bit busier than usual but nothing I can't handle. I've been a bit tearful at times but I've just got on with it i suppose despite feeling generally quite low.

Then last night he told me he cheated on me. 

We've been together for a few years. Now part of me thought I would go mad, shout and scream etc. I had tears coming from my eyes but I wasn't proper crying it was weird. As its upsetting but I just feel numb. I don't feel like I have any emotion and it almost feels like I've just shut down. Like what is the point in life and caring about anything.

I used to drink a lot in the past. It was I guess my coping mechanism and it served me well for around 10 years. Now I don't appear to have one and all I want is to drink and curl up in bed and have a good sleep. 

But for now...I'm just sitting here not quite knowing what to do with myself.

Is it a valid depressive episode if I also feel good and excited from time to time?,"(I was diagnosed more than one year ago, but my therapist told me I had symptoms which were below moderate, so we didn’t talk much about it. I had to give up on therapy before the pandemic started. I’m still learning how to identify a potential depressive episode.)

I’ve been feeling very strange and different for two months now, without any particular reason. Most of the time I feel numb, sometimes to the point where I can barely smile or laugh no matter what I see/hear, I’m tired and very indifferent to anything. I lost my appetite and can’t focus. 

However, there are several moments or even days when I feel good, as if I’m suddenly healed. For example, I felt pretty low and depressed today, I stayed in my bed the entire day but I’ve just got a random rush of energy and pleasure while listening to music. I felt happy and excited for one hour and my depression symptoms seemed to disappear during that time. 

I also get excited watching a movie, reading or hanging out with my friends. I didn’t completely lose my interest in all the activities and I’m actually capable of feeling regular emotions. The problem is that I will definitely come back to my inexplicable numbness after a short period of time. 

I’m sorry if it’s a stupid question, but does it still count as a depressive episode? Is it normal to also feel good and excited for short periods of time?",yourborderline,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/od4iwl/is_it_a_valid_depressive_episode_if_i_also_feel/,wa diagnosed one year ago therapist told symptom moderate talk much give therapy pandemic started still learning identify potential depressive episode feeling strange different two month without particular reason time feel numb sometimes point barely smile laugh matter see hear tired indifferent anything lost appetite focus however several moment even day feel good suddenly healed example felt pretty low depressed today stayed bed entire day got random rush energy pleasure listening music felt happy excited one hour depression symptom seemed disappear time also get excited watching movie reading hanging friend completely lose interest activity actually capable feeling regular emotion problem definitely come back inexplicable numbness short period time sorry stupid question doe still count depressive episode normal also feel good excited short period time,valid depressive episode also feel good excited time time,1377,83

¿How related is my lack of empathy with my depression?,"As i said i lack empathy and contrary to what people may think i'm not an asshole to other people, is just that i don't get the feelings of other people, not even people close to me, if my mother or my bestfriend is sad in any way i just can't care for them and that is kinda sad that i can't connect at all with anybody and sometimes i feel lonely because of it.

I am depressed, i have been for a few years, but i can't correlate my depression with my lack of empathy, and i cannot recieve help because i'm not able to understand the feelings of those that are willing to help me if any, that is what i believe.

I don't think that those two condition are correlated, i didn't got depression because i lack empathy or maybe i did, i don't know. ¿The lack of empathy worsened my condition?, i have low emotional inteligence and i cannot comprehend what i am going through and i have nobody who i want to talk IRL about this, what a life.",Sdrezzel,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/od4hh9/how_related_is_my_lack_of_empathy_with_my/,said lack empathy contrary people may think asshole people get feeling people even people close mother bestfriend sad way care kinda sad connect anybody sometimes feel lonely depressed year correlate depression lack empathy cannot recieve help able understand feeling willing help believe think two condition correlated got depression lack empathy maybe know lack empathy worsened condition low emotional inteligence cannot comprehend going nobody want talk irl life,related lack empathy depression,938,54

Keep seeing people on LinkedIn who laid me off in my past company,"Last year I was laid off despite working super hard. I strongly feel the reason was that my manager betrayed me by pinning blame on me for a mistake that he made, and I was too dumb to stand up for myself. I totally trusted my manager, not feeling the need to prove the work that I was doing to others in the company, but he just threw me under the bus without a moment’s notice in front of the CEO. And a month later the CEO fired me.

I am trying to move past it. But I keep seeing “recommendations” on LinkedIn for employees from that company, including the people who fired me, and those who replaced me. 

Today i was studying for an interview and I saw those recommendations again, and it was like the straw that broke the camel’s back. I want to move past it and prepare for future interviews, but I am not able to focus. I finally blocked everyone from that company but I am feeling immobile due to stress and crazy emotional and pathetic about myself, and like a huge loser remembering that bad phase of my life. I know you should keep an emotional distance from your coworkers but a part of me also feels betrayed, although it’s my own fault for not showcasing my hard work and results to everyone in the company.

Meaning of life,"Hey everyone, I’ve (22m) been struggling a lot recently with my mental health. Since covid I have dropped a lot of friends, gave up on family, ended up not getting my diploma from uni, ended a relationship with a girl who really cared about me, and have no inkling of an idea for a job that calls to my passion. Only thing i really excel at is video games but it’s too late to pursue that talent now (truly) so i have been in a fog for a while trying to figure things out - especially finding a job that I’ll enjoy.  I ended up going for doordash temporarily but working long hours doing so makes me irate. I really have no idea where I’m gonna go. I feel like a failure to everyone in my life and with student loan payments about to hit me in November, i really don’t know how I’ll survive. However, I’m still able to find meaning in my day to day. Perhaps it’s because I’m still with parents and not completely homeless that makes me feel secure deep down, but with everything aforementioned my pride is non existent and confidence 0%; yet willing to live 100%.

So i come here to offer up my subjectivities because I’ve been reading a lot of suicide mentions and i don’t believe ya’ll should go through with it.

My argument for existence over death is simple: the senses. When you die (assuming there is no after life) there is nothing. ‘Nothing’ can’t be measured, felt, or expressed because human consciousness don’t compute like dat. Even though i wake up every single day feeling like absolute shit inside, i am still able to feel, listen, see, smell, move, and think. And hell some days… i take that for granted.  The days i get embarrassed, make a mistake, injure myself, remember trauma, or get treated with disrespect… i wanna end it all.. but fuck em. 

There is something really special about being alive - even from a strictly selfish point of view. Feeling pain, loneliness, embarrassment, discomfort, and or thinking thoughts of pure mortal dread reminds us that life is poetically hellish. However.. that pain (whether physical or form in thought) is good because it reminds you that you can sense existence. You can breathe and create metaphor, wonder and look up to the stars. There’s philosophy and music, genius anime and captivating film. There’s sex (porn doesn’t count as feeling sex) and great tastes. There’s laughter, horror, romance.. and to top it all off: there’s others who sense like you - who appreciate the same things and chase after similar goals, but also there are others that feel similar dread and worry about same type of situations. Now if you’re like me, you probably won’t meet those people in real life.. but they exist, and there’s comfort in knowing that. You aren’t alone - in theory. But you have to embrace that and enjoy the selfishness of your life for what it is: sensed. Dying won’t do any good; if you feel like a burden on life then life has yet to match you. But please.. be okay with being a ‘burden’! BE A FUCKING BURDEN DUDE! Who cares?? Word probably is.. you feeling like a burden (assumption) is actually you feeling insecure about being yourself. And such feeling probably comes from judgment by an environment that is completely disassociated from your personality - only to be placed on you because of mere chance. After all.. you didn’t ask to live during the internet boom/meta.

Listen i can’t make you do anything.. perhaps I’m writing this so i distract myself from going down that rabbit hole, but i will tell you that if you allocate focus to the essence behind your senses (touch, taste, smell, vision, thought, and sound) i think there is a lot to appreciate which makes life worth living. I’m not gonna say there’s people who care about you, cuz well.. there may well be no one (I’ve accepted this about myself), but humanity  - regardless of the bad - has presented a lot of great things from within its wake, and it’s thanks to the senses. 

You don’t have to be rich, popular, or situated in a loving family. Or maybe you do.. and if so.. be quick about it. You have to start somewhere.. and when deciding on how to, with no proper instruction, it’s best to just take the ol’ fashioned risk and keep asking people your questions until you figure it out. But until you decide when to start (fuck procrastination) enjoy the gift of life - the senses - while you can. 

Do not fear death, but don’t rush it. 

Good luck everyone. Thanks for reading.

"Instead of hurting myself, I wrote.","Time passes by, year after year. I feel so far away. Minutes turn to hours and hours turn to days. I want this feeling to stop. I want to feel okay.

Looking back on the past, all the time I wasted. Once, death is what I longed for, some days I could taste it.

Looking back on memories, I don't want to lose a thing. Can you see it in my eyes? I've been distant. I can't tell if this is the beginning or the end. I know I haven't been myself, I'll admit it. Rend.

You are my light when it's too dark to see. I see you in my dreams. I stare into your eyes and I see my future gleam. A moment with you is a moment of peace. Without you, it's piece; after piece. I tear myself apart. The voices, they get so vicious, it feels like I'm rippin' stitches. You are my sanity. You are my heart.

I'm staring at the ceiling. I can't shake this feeling; jaded. Everything is faded. The walls are closing in. Agitation becomes frustration. Air becomes thin.

I pick up the knife and slice once, twice, thrice. I'm gone, gone and going. Going, going and gone. I lay on the floor crying, bleeding, panicked. You're behind the door crying, starving, manic'd.

Breathe in and breathe out, that's what I tell myself. Doubt. There's hope in my mind, but the fire is drowning inside.

I'm cut up into pieces. I'm looking for a reason. I can't stop the bleeding. I'm looking for a meaning. Throw me a line, I can't do this on my own. I spend every waking night disconnected. Alone.

All I ever wanted was to find someone. Holding it together is the hardest part. Holding you is the best part of me. Every time we speak, words don't do it justice.

Nothing ever changes,"None of this ever gets easier. Nothing helps, doesn’t matter what the fuck I do. I’m trapped in an endless fucking cycle of constant suffering. Right now I’m sitting here typing this sitting on the weights bench in my basement because I can even get my arms to reach down and pick up the weights. I’m just hunched over with my head hanging down doing nothing like a fucking Idiot, just cycling between gritting my teeth to try not to cry and just feeling completely empty. 

This always fucking happens, I’ve been here so many times but the cycle never ends. I don’t even get good days, just kinda shitty days and really shitty days. It’s never better. Nothing makes a difference. Therapy isn’t helping me. Not at all. All the medications don’t do a fucking thing. Exercising, eating right, still no fucking change. It doesn’t matter how much effort I put in, how hard I try, I’m still in the same fucking hell loop.

I don’t look forward to anything. I don’t want anything, except to not have to feel anymore. I used to want things but all that’s done for me is open my eyes to why I either can’t have those things or don’t want those things. I wish I could just think super hard and give myself an aneurysm or a heart attack or something and then it would just be over. 

Nothing gives me purpose. I derive no meaning from any sort of work. I don’t like to create things and I lack the focus to anyway. Helping people doesn’t make me feel anything at all. The is no meaning to my life at all and I can’t give myself any no matter what I try.

The only eventful thing that seems to happen in my life is that I constantly get completely crippled by my own mind. I feel like I’m living on a planet where for some reason gravity acts much stronger on me so everyone else seems to be able to walk around with no issues but even just standing up is a constant battle for me and I just look like a freak because no one else around me feels what I feel and they can’t see it either so they don’t understand. And now I don’t even know why I try to stand up anymore, it doesn’t get me anywhere and I’d be better off just letting the gravity finally crush me.

Don’t even know why I’m typing this, I guess it’s just my way of sitting on this fucking weights bench telling myself I’m doing *something*. I’ve already heard all the usual advice and none of it helps. I already go to therapy, I already do the things they tell me to, it doesn’t help at all. I’m already on medication, I’ve been on so many by this point, none of them made any difference at all. I’ve heard that “it gets better” a hundred times from people who just tell you to wait an indeterminate amount of time for something that may or may not actually happen, as if that’s some comfort. Besides, you can say I’m just being negative and pessimistic when I say I know I’ll still get like this again in a matter of months, but you can’t say I’m wrong because all the evidence points in the other direction. And because someone always says it, I’m not calling a suicide hotline. I don’t even know who those things exist for, those calls have only ever made me feel more suicidal afterwards, they’re less than useless.",BadCaseOfBrainShakes,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ocwkcr/nothing_ever_changes/,none ever get easier nothing help matter fuck trapped endless fucking cycle constant suffering right sitting typing sitting weight bench basement even get arm reach pick weight hunched head hanging nothing like fucking idiot cycling gritting teeth try cry feeling completely empty always fucking happens many time cycle never end even get good day kinda shitty day really shitty day never better nothing make difference therapy helping medication fucking thing exercising eating right still fucking change matter much effort put hard try still fucking hell loop look forward anything want anything except feel anymore used want thing done open eye either thing want thing wish could think super hard give aneurysm heart attack something would nothing give purpose derive meaning sort work like create thing lack focus anyway helping people make feel anything meaning life give matter try eventful thing seems happen life constantly get completely crippled mind feel like living planet reason gravity act much stronger everyone else seems able walk around issue even standing constant battle look like freak one else around feel feel see either understand even know try stand anymore get anywhere better letting gravity finally crush even know typing guess way sitting fucking weight bench telling something already heard usual advice none help already go therapy already thing tell help already medication many point none made difference heard get better hundred time people tell wait indeterminate amount time something may may actually happen comfort besides say negative pessimistic say know still get like matter month say wrong evidence point direction someone always say calling suicide hotline even know thing exist call ever made feel suicidal afterwards le useless,nothing ever change,3172,20
Am I spoiled or am I depressed?,"I'm a 15 year old male. My family has always struggled with finances ever since we moved from Oregon when I was only 4. Right now we rent out a small house that technically has three bedrooms for a family of seven. Whenever my parents would take my laptop and phone, I would spiral down into a very deep depressive-like state. Not because I was without my games or music, but because that was the only way to talk to my friends, and more importantly, my boyfriend. I've never been clinically tested for depression because my parents believe I'm just a spoiled teen with raging hormones, but I've been feeling worthless and hopeless for several years. My friends are the only ones who tell me to keep going, that they promise that they'll always be there for me even when I feel all alone. So when my only way of speaking to them is taken away from me for one reason or another, I have this conflict inside me of whether I actually need to talk to them or if I'm just some spoiled brat. There's something to be said about whether my parents are just strict or abusive but I don't think this is the right sub for that.

I'm so done with everything and everyone,"I WAS feeling better with my medication, but this last week it was bad again. Missing my ex. Although I know he's an asshole and doesn't deserve me, but whatever. Can't stop that feeling. First I broke a friendship of almost 20 years because she only wanted me for the good times and thought I was being dramatic when I had a depressive episode. Didn't support me. Saw me just as inconvenient for her. So after years of this, I was done. 

Now, my best friend of 10 years is turning against me. She says she distants herself from me because I cost her too much energy. Nice thing to say to someone who is already suicidal and thinks everyone hates them and doesn't care about them. And I have ALWAYS been there for her. When she was depressed, when she had panic attacks, when she was in an abusive relationship for years, I never left her side EVEN THOUGH it cost me very much energy and I was also dealing with my own shit.

I fucking hate people and I don't know what I'm still doing here. Clearly no one gives a fuck about me. I'm a burden. It's not convenient for them. Blablabla. Fuck that and fuck all of them. And they will all cry when I'm dead and say they did everything they could. They didn't. I already wrote my suicide note a few weeks ago but I'm making some adjustments.

I know my parents want the best for me but they're alcoholics and can't talk about emotions so they can't support me either. No one can. And yes I'm on medication and I'm going through therapy.

( have been working hard without missing work for over a month ). The following night I go to bed at 3 am ( nothing different than my usual bedtime ) and I over sleep until 12 or 1 pm !!! My alarms didn’t go off and I awake to 3 missed calls from my work asking what time I’m coming in. I’m extremely frantic at this point and become stuck out of fear and don’t give them an answer until it’s too late for me to come in. I sent a text but no reply . Today i was supposed to go to work at 8:30 am I left on time however my motorcycle wouldn’t start and the gear is now stuck . I instantly texted my work asking if I can come in at 3 pm .

"Living with my aunt is worsening my symptoms, I can't afford to move. These last 10 months have been horrible for my mental health and I don't know what to do anymore. I could use some advice/insight because I don't know how to keep functioning like this","**TL;DR**: Living with my aunt is damaging my mental health, moving back in with my parents would be even worse. I took/am taking 1.5 yrs off school for mental health and to save up tuition money, but my mental health has been constantly deteriorating and the only way I could (somewhat) preserve it would affect my savings.

I (22F) have been living with my aunt and uncle for 5-ish months and my aunt takes issue with and belittles me for my ""lifestyle choices,"" ie how all my outfits ""look the same"", I don't own any ""nice"" clothes, I leave my clothes on the floor, I don't leave the house except for work or grocery shopping, I don't cook meals from scratch, I don't wear makeup, I don't go on dates, I don't socialize/have friends in the area, *and* that I go to counseling (a ""cash grab/scam"").  
I absolutely hate it, and every time I speak up and tell her I don't like it she calls me sensitive/touchy/some other adjective with the same meaning. If I say that I'm stressed at my job, she'll say that she's had horrible jobs in the past but she stuck with it cause she had kids to feed and bills to pay; if I reference my mental illness, she'll say that she used to be terribly depressed and s\*icidal but she buckled down and made it through it; if I vent or worry about tuition costs, she'll say that she also had to take out a loan and work a part-time job to get through college and she managed it just fine. It's a constant series of dismissals and 'I had it worse' and it just wears me down.  
She also doesn't hold back from doing this in public in front of strangers/her friends, which is why I now avoid going on shopping trips with her, eating out with my aunt and uncle when they invite me, or going to church with them. All of this causes her to become more upset and judgmental of my choices.

I hate this so much. She speaks to my uncle in much the same way, says that he ""wants everyone to like him"" whenever he acts considerate of strangers (letting a car merge, is patient with a new employee, etc), so at least there's comfort in knowing it's not just me. This has also provided invaluable insight into why my older cousin was considered a ""problem child;"" she has strong boundaries and doesn't put up with other peoples BS.

Moving back with my parents isn't an option, and while I could technically afford living on my own if I got another job, but having just one job is so draining already and I don't know if I could handle it. Additionally, I'm taking time off from school to save money and living alone would be a drain on my savings and make the whole gap year (and a half) pointless.

I just don't know what to do. To be honest, it's not just living with my aunt; everything in my life has been pretty shitty since last September. This is only the latest stressor.

Past teenage nightmare that ruined my life.,"So, I was always a hairy female more than other women thanks to weird genetics. When I was 17 my mother decided she wanted to take me to the doctor to see if there’s a magic pill to stop the hair from growing. She was especially concerned with the fine and dark hairs on my back because she said, “ they are too long.” Well , I ended up going to a primary doctor that decided I needed more estrogen without checking my hormones. I ended up growing thicker and stronger hair and it devastated me and put me into a depression. After that everything in my life went downhill. I was sent to get married overseas thinking it would be best for me which was the biggest mistake besides the estrogen. I married a guy that would emotionally abuse me to the extreme because of my hairiness and physically abuse me harshly . I stayed out of fear and self esteem issues. I left him after almost two decades and I am still emotionally damaged.

Should I go to a 12 step dual diagnosis OR a mental health partial hospitalization program?,"So long story short, my depression has been ruling my life in one way or another for the past 10 years. I don't feel as if addiction is at the core of my issues, moreso depression. Right now I'm staying sober fine and just finishing up my last couple days of Suboxone to come off of kratom. However, I'm painfully aware that when I come off of the Suboxone I'm going to be super duper ultra mega depressed with nowhere to turn.

I really need to learn how to manage my life and push through the pain and hardships in order to move forward even if the depression doesn't improve right away. Essentially I need life skills. I never really learned coping mechanisms, self care, structure, how to build relationships, confidence, perseverance etc... I've basically turned to exercise, food, significant others, dabbled in various substances for as long as I can remember to kind of cope. I've had problems with alcohol in the past but it's something that I don't have problems with and don't feel powerless over. I don't enjoy drinking and I'm not in active addiction.

My question is, will the 12 steps give me the tools I need to do that? I will also have access to medication in that 30 day program, along with individual counseling.

My other option would be a PHP program focusing more on medications and CBT/DBT. Both programs offer daily therapy and groups, but one is more focused on substance use and the other is more focused on general mental disorders.

I’m lost and care but can’t do shit about it,"TW: death &amp; abuse

Hello, for background I have ptsd &amp; hypomania, bipolar 2. 
I’m the youngest of the family by quite some years. My dad just lost a 2 year battle with cancer as of June 25th, 7 days now. I haven’t been working for the last 7 months now. I quit abruptly one morning before work becausei was overly stressed out. My gf was in and out of hospitalization from a recent schizoaffective disorder diagnosis along with my dad being sick, and the children I was taking care of at work were coming home full time along with their friends I’d watch w no compensation. Anyways I’m an avid dumpster diver &amp; have been for 2.5 years now. I make enough money to pay my bills doing that. I’m ready to work. I think. I am incredibly depressed but the mania is eating me alive.  I just applied for Medicaid so I can have help w a therapist. I just feel like I’m losing my mind. There’s a lot going on that I can’t wrap my head around and I want to escape. I want to be happy again. I moved to south Florida 5 years ago &amp; stayed for 2 years before moving back and I swear I haven’t been happy since. I feel trapped. I have a great family here don’t get me wrong but we all live very different lives. I have no friends at home so I feel incredibly alone. I do have one friend I have had since middle school but she is a mom of 3 so she is very busy. My mania is telling me to get on my shit so I can leave. I WORK. I like to work. This last year I haven’t and it has been very weird. I’m social and I do not have that anymore. I don’t want to leave my family during such a confusing time, but I feel like I need to BUT my depression leaves me to sulk in bed, dream of everything I know I can do with determination. Yet I do nothing. My mom was a stay at home mom, I saw her at home so I don’t know if I see that and think well I’ll be all right cus mom was, or if it’s the fact that as long as I’m not on drugs no one seems to care what anyone is doing. I get things done with encouragement. As soon as someone tells me to do something I do it instantly, but I cannot do it on my own. The things I know I can do my brain tells me I can’t. I feel like an imposter. I’m losing it and my gf is a huge distraction. I love her but not that way anymore. I know it’s wrong. I am I love w someone else. They’re in Florida, we are friends there hasn’t been any cheating whatso ever, but for 2 years I have thought of him day in and day out. I do think it sounds nuts but I didnt plan life to be this way. And I’m so worried to hurt her (gf) After her diagnosis. Itso fucked. I also just bought a 2500 car that is shit… I didn’t realize the floor board was rusted out so there the cherry on that.

Idek anymore,"Let me summarize my life.

I was born to an affluent family

I go to a private school

I’ve been made fun of and bullied since I was 5.

I get laughed at for the most random things which everyone does. I got ridiculed for having a crush on a girl.

Every time I make a small mistake, I get yelled at constantly by everyone.

Not a single adult knows about any of this.

When I tell my classmates about my issues, (notice how I don’t call them friends, more on that later) they laugh at me and say I’m completely fine.

I dont have any friends. People around me say they’re friendly with me, but its only when they need something. When I require support in any way, no one is there.

My parents are very good and hard working people, but they are very pressurizing towards me, but I guess thats just the Indian mindset. 

I have attempted suicide numerous times during lockdown, (I lost count). I try to suffocate myself while sleeping cuz I think that would be the most painless way to go.

No one ever acknowledges my good work/deeds, but always focus on the negatives, no matter how small they are. If I get a 97/100 in a practice paper, my parents always point out stuff like “Why did u lose 3 marks” and “Why is your handwriting so bad”
“If you weren’t so lazy and unaccomplished, you would do better in life” (the last comment is a recurring theme)

I’m also very harsh on myself. For example, sometimes I think I’m a self-serving narcissist because I refused to help a classmate with some work. This is probably because of the values I was raised with, where I should help everyone and stuff like that.

The only reason I exist right now is to enjoy Youtube videos, play Valorant, sleep, and listen to The Beatles, Nirvana, Eminem, and Bob Dylan.
Also I’m looking forward to my IGCSE exams, so that I hopefully do well in them and not be a complete disappointment to my parents.

I want to be alone,"I'm fighting a depression and anxiety disorder right now and also just got the diagnos body dysmorphia. The depression I've been fighting for a over a year.

And I feel like I don't have the energy for my parentes, like the drain me. The expect me to come over every weekend and almost get hurt or something when I don't (I'm 25) and I feel like I have a obligation to go over to them because I'm the youngest and my sisters has husband and kids now. It feels like I'm leaving my parents to be alone.

And the always gives me comments, like you will never be able to work for the rest of your life, you gonna live on social service money for the rest of your life. The can be nice during the days, but then at evening when the drink you clearly see that the are lying and spit out every truth the don't dare to say otherwise.

She also don't believe in my body dysmorphia, and says that I'm just too lazy to take care of myself and I look like a homeless person while in fact I've just given up because I'm so ugly and people stare at me anyways.

Not saying the aren't nice. She usually gives me a lift if I need it, borrows me some money if I need it..

My sisters never talks to me or care. The don't ask how things are going or how I am, if I need help with something or want to hang out and if I ask them it's weird. I always keep being nice to them, giving gift to my nephews even tough I barely can afford it and I never get a thank you.

I wrote a text to my parentes saying I need a break and I'm tired of all the comments about me and blocked their number. I've only texted once in a week to say I'm fine and not to worry..

I was considering getting a semi-colon tattoo but…,"I saw a post on Instagram about someone with a semi-colon tattoo, and it made me happy to see but then I looked at the comments and saw a bunch of people saying that they’re doing it to get attention.

There was even a person who said he’s had deep depression but he said this is just attention-seeking behavior.

I’ve been considering getting one as a reminder to myself that I’m going to stay alive to help me feel at peace. I figured it would also be nice if someone recognizes it in public and relates to me about it. 

It’s insane how ignorant people can be. Depression is different for every single person, just because you wouldn’t benefit from getting it doesn’t mean other people wouldn’t. When are people finally going to realize that each person has their own different brain, experiences, emotions, and that just because you haven’t felt a particular feeling before, doesn’t mean no one does

After that it went down hill and she basically acted like she never had known about me or just cared about me in general. Its been 3 days since and I can't anymore. I feel lost and I just feel like there is no point in fighting. I use like ASMR girlfriend videos just to lose some anxiety and so I can calm down at night but I just cry and barely get any sleep.

Existing is getting harder each day,"I have no desire for it. I never asked to be here. Every day it gets harder to move, to get out of bed, brush my teeth, etc. Basic things like self care just don’t matter. I feel so little motivation to keep doing this every day.

I never thought I'd be on here...,"I'm.. really scared to post this.. but I feel like.. I need to get this out there...
For over a year now.. I have suspected I had depression.
I don't want to say 100% I do, since I have not been professionally diagnosed and I do not have the courage, or the money to ask my mom to take me to see a professional..
In the mornings, they aren't bad, because I usually talk to my online friends to keep me company, it's usually when I'm completely alone, especially when it's night that the bad thoughts start flooding in.
I really.. hate myself.. I feel talentless.. I have this overwhelming fear that I won't live up to my own or even the world's expectations, that I'll die alone.. I look in the mirror and I don't.. like me... I understand that I'm annoying, I understand that in the end my experiences aren't as important as others, that I'm just a stupid kid that'll never survive the real world.
And.. these feelings I've been dealing with.. since early 2020.
I think these thoughts, along with a regrettable reliance on the internet has caused some form of insomnia. 

Now.. the reason I decided to post this here is that I'm scared.. to tell my mom..
I have a friend that I have told about my feelings and they've helped a little, but I don't really want to just dump everything on them.. the reason I'm afraid to tell my mom is.. because recently my dad died and we are struggling financially.. there's a possibility we won't be able to afford a proper funeral..
So I can't imagine the pain and fear it would put on my mom, that after loosing the love of her life, that her own daughter, feels so worthless.
I don't necassarily want to end my life.. because that's just more pain on my mom.. I know other people in my city won't care if I'm gone.. at the same time life doesn't exactly feel worth living either...
In a way I'm.. scared to die...
That sounds stupid I know it does.

Overall I'm just.. loss... I don't even know if this even is depression or not.
Maybe I just don't want to admit something is wrong..? I don't know...

Looking for advice on my next step in treatment,"Sorry if this is the wrong sub for this question! 

These are all of the medications I’ve been on over the last seven years: 

Fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem)

Sertraline (Zoloft)

Venlafaxine (Effexor) BAD

Duloxetine (Cymbalta) BAD

Bupropion (Welbutrin, Aplenzin) 

Mirtazapine (Remeron)

Trazodone (Desyrel)

Lamotragine (Lamictal)

Quetiapine Fumarate (Seroquel) 

Clonazepam (Klonopin)

Lorazepam (Ativan)

Alprazolam (Xanax)

Escitalopram (Lexapro) 

None of them have “worked” for longer than a couple of months. I’m currently being seen by a gastroenterologist for horrible GI issues and am pretty confident that in a couple of days they’re going to tell me all of my problems are stemming from taking SSRIS because 90% of your serotonin receptors are in your gut and being on these pills can be hard on your stomach.

If they tell me that I can’t take SSRIS anymore, where does that leave me? I was interested in getting ECT until I read about the horrible years long side effects it can leave you with and now I feel like I’m out of options because I’ve tried so many types of pills. 

Obviously a psychiatrist is the one who will decide what I do next if I can’t have my SSRIS anymore, but I won’t be able to see one for another month or so and I’m feeling anxious about what lies in store for me treatment-wise. I’m just wondering if there’s something besides ect or weekly therapy that could be recommended to me?

Loneliness I can’t shake,I’ve had this loneliness that has followed me since the day I was born.

I’m getting nowhere in life and have no goals plans or ambitions. My entire life feels like trying to start the car in the mud and it stalls unable to go anywhere. Everytime someone tells me “it’s okay not everyone is on the same life path don’t compare yourself to others or feel behind” it pushes me one step closer to wanting to end it all.

I feel backed into a corner in my life..,"I feel like that's all I can say.. truth is I'm losing my mind. I'm slowly but surely sinking back into a dark place. My girlfriend just said that I'm strong mentally but that shell is cracking.. I'm so close to giving up on literally everything. I feel pressured. I feel neglected. I feel hated.  I feel unloved from my mother. Why does she reject the only thing in my life that is constantly trying to make me happy(my girlfriend) and has saved my life. If it wasn't for her I guarantee you I would be dead right now.

 I hate living like this. I hate the feeling. I'm in so much pain that no one can see through cause I can't let anyone see through it. I have to stay strong for all my friends. If I'm ever dead. Or seeking death. Jumping infront of bullets to save a life. I'm not a hero. I just wanted to die.

 My mother has ruined my whole life and just continues to ruin it further. I hope that if I ever have a daughter she is 10000% better than my mom. I know her mother isn't going to just abandon her like mine did me. Honestly I'm happy she didn't raise me. My grandma/her mother is an actual mother. My mother had kids then forgot about them cause she wanted daughters I guess.

 We're constantly neglected, me especially. I'm just numb and at this point I don't know what to do. Talking to my mom just makes me wish I had a gun so I could end it all. I want to take my life every time she speaks to me. She's not healthy for me or the family I'm trying to raise and as such my kids will have a singular grandmother from my wife's side and if she still lives and even if she dies I'll tell them that my grandmother was my mother. With all my heart. I'm at a wall in my life and I just want to smash every bone in my body to the point of nothingness. I say it with all my heart I hate my life and genuinely whole heartedly didn't want to be born into this world.

I don't really have anyone I can talk to as feel like I'm so use to putting on this happy go lucky act around everyone that people don't believe me or take me seriously when I try to explain I'm struggling with the most basic of tasks. I don't want to bother my mum as she just worries about me and my sister has a lot on her plate with a new born and a toddler. My boyfriend and his family are very much if you haven't got a reason to be sad then don't be and have never experienced or understand mental health so they're not the most sensitive and end up making me feel even more guilty and worse for feeling like this.

I've started taking myself off just to cry and prefer being alone and pushing people away which I know isn't healthy but I can't seem to stop myself as I just feel guilty for being sad and boring and can't control my emotions at the moment and don't know when or what will cause my next crying episode which makes me feel so stupid.

I hate wellness checks.,"TW Mention of suicide:

Police show up at my door @ 1:30am for a mental well-being check. I rang the suicide hotline and I was talking quite a lot of shit to them, before just giving up on the conversation and hanging up on the sorry individual on the other side of the line. 

Anyways, they get concerned and call for a wellness check. Which isn’t ideal considering that community resources are garbage. They would only be there to send me to a hospital and go on with their day. 

In conclusion, I’m getting worse mentally. There isn’t a day that goes by where I don’t think about killing myself. What do I do?

Is suicide the only real option?,"I've been contemplation suicide for years but ultimately I knew I was too big of a pussy to go through with it. I'd make a plan but know that deep down know that I can't bring myself to do it.

How do you guys do it? How do you guys choose to keep on living? How do you guys wake up every day and go to work? How do you live with the fact that life is eat-sleep-work for 60 years and then you die?

I haven't left the house in six years... SIX YEARS. The anxiety from my mom telling me to go take my diploma from my uni and see if I can get a job was immense.  How the fuck am I supposed to work when I have 0 skills and I can't even bring myself to go outside. 

The only thing that kept me going the past few months was GME but it was insanely delusional to think that it could save my life. Who knows how many years pass until it squeezes or how many more illegal shit they'd pull to try and prevent it again. It was my only shot but like with everything I missed. Not that money magically solves all problems. Look at reckful or Chester; but it was a way for me to get a bit more time and to explore whether or not I want to live. The only thing I can now do is sell my PC and phone and give myself a month or two buffer. I guess we are back to GME or bust just like in january but this time it's the final yard.

my life is a cycle. i feel trapped. i’ve been living the same life for 3 years. i’m stuck. help.,"I have been depressed for about 3 years now and I’m only 18. 

At 16, my high school girlfriend broke up with me, my step dad physically abused me, and I started doing drugs. 

At 17, I dropped out of high school, got kicked out of my house multiple times, then moved in with my bio dad in another state. 

I turned 18 and a few months later and my bio dad kicked me out of his motor home trailer. He also stole hundreds of dollars from me. Now i’m living with my parents again and I have a comfortable living situation. 

I live the same day over and over. I smoke weed everyday to just feel something. My parents don’t like me and I don’t like them very much either. They are mormon too. 

I have a fast food job that I just started but it’s pretty boring. It’s my third one too. 

I eat healthy for the most part too and i’m good at running, skating, and biking. I’m a 5’10 male and i’m pretty lean. 

I have to ride my bike everywhere because I can’t drive and my parents won’t help me obtain my license. It takes twice as long to get anywhere. 

My life is okay but I often hate it and wish I could be someone or somewhere else.

i cannot figure out why i just wanna die so badly,"ever since i could remember i’ve always really just hated the idea of being alive. it took me til i was about 13 years old to realize that being miserable wasn’t everybody’s primary mindset.

i grew up on a farm almost completely isolated from everybody. i was taught that i should never express how i felt to anybody. and i did homeschool most of my life until highschool. so i never really had a chance to communicate with anybody.

my parents were extremely strict. if i even threw away the burnt crust of a pizza i was told to eat it from the trash can. i wasn’t allowed to watch television much, i would occasionally see my cousins but i wasn’t allowed to be away from home much at all. 

my dad calls me names like “feminin baby boy”, or really just anything that made me feel like i was less of a human than i should be. he would hit me multiple times a week, and then told me if i said anything id be shipped away to people who beat me worse than him. 

now i have moved away from home and my mom is finally getting a divorce. i don’t have a whole lot to worry about anymore, but yet i still feel lonely and miserable. 

i wont kill myself because i know how much it would affect people. but i feel like there is nothing that can make me feel happy or even glad to be alive.",greygorrilaftp,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ocshcy/i_cannot_figure_out_why_i_just_wanna_die_so_badly/,ever since could remember always really hated idea alive took til wa 13 year old realize miserable everybody primary mindset grew farm almost completely isolated everybody wa taught never express felt anybody homeschool life highschool never really chance communicate anybody parent extremely strict even threw away burnt crust pizza wa told eat trash allowed watch television much would occasionally see cousin allowed away home much dad call name like feminin baby boy really anything made feel like wa le human would hit multiple time week told said anything id shipped away people beat worse moved away home mom finally getting divorce whole lot worry anymore yet still feel lonely miserable wont kill know much would affect people feel like nothing make feel happy even glad alive,cannot figure wanna die badly,1282,49

I dont know what to,"I just posted this r/LifeAdvice but after posting it there i felt a bit of my shoulders and maybe let more now will help i just dont know but it felt good to bring it out for once

 honestly I don't even know what to do at this point or how to even start this so from the beginning would be the best choice so it gonna be long. For starters im a male now for most of my childhood my parents argued and i had to deal with my dad being an acholic going to bars just so my mom could find out he left with the neighbors after she got back from work and always arguing with my mom the constant fighting the violence, as time went my dad starting cheating and the arguing got worst as the years went so you could say some of my issues with relationships come from back then. i either remember just being quite as my parent argued siting quietly as they argued i just sat there in the kitchen but the whole time i saw them them the whole time since we lived in a single apartment so no privacy (since it was the kitchen bathroom and living room/bedroom only). i thought that if i did good everything would be ok but every time i tried do something either i did it bad or not to his standers either i was dumb lazy and i didn't live up to expectations and was a disappointment and with the follow up of being punished. i felt like shit for most of my life . As the years went by i went through 3 of their separations since they wanted to work it out but honestly i think they didn't want to be a lone as we live away from any family since everyone lives in a different country. until i got to jr year of highschool i met her. what i felt was the only ray of sunshine i had so i didn't want to lose it and made my self a promised not to do what my parents did. Moving forward i graduated my dad stopped (because of health problems) being an acholic and they tried fixed the problems they had. I got into college and i was still with her since it was the only time i really felt happy was when i was by her side. we moved together i was over the moon i had someone i loved and a what i felt was a home. so we found out we weren't making enough so after we talked we came that i would work full time as she went to school and worked part time after she was done it would have been my turn to finish so i took 3 jobs (1full and 2 part) so we could pull thru together i made so i could have so i could i one full day with her and 1 evening every week i didn't mind since i loved her. i thought every thing was ok between us. one day she told she was pregnant i got excited since i vowed to be better than my dad. i has more happy every month since it was one month closer to meet my daughter. the day cam she was giving birth then whole time she was labour i was worried happy a whole serious of emotion that i cant really put into paper or explain. when i was told the i she had given birth and was holding her i ran into the room thats when i saw she wasnt my kid as her skin color didn't match anyone and she would look at me i asked with all the courage if she was mine but no answer she didn't even turn to me . i don't know what happen that after that a week went by and i drank for most of it even if hated any kind of alcohol since it reminded me of dad in the past and promised to my self that i would die with out ever even trying it. At that time my parent were doing better they stopped fighting everything they made up completely and they called me i said i had trouble in life They told me to go live with them since i had no one else since and i never told never told them what happen since i was a 3 they always told me never talk with people with what is private and to not tell other with what is happens inside the house as it private and other people don't need to know since its not their business to know maybe that's why i could never open up to anyone completely and before you guys asked she knew a little but not everything since that was driven in to my head like a religious scripture. 6 years has passed i haven't told any one any of this and this whole time i just felt like i have been in auto pilot and i have tried to fill the gap with anything but i couldn't ever.i just didn't have the strength to move forward. my parent never thought that something was wrong since for the depression only happen when you're not happy and since they saw me smiling and laughing and with that mind set i thought i wasn't and with what i felt was normal once again. in the end i got addicted to smoking weed taking edible since it was the fastest i could get and the only time i didn't feel anything was when i was high. i tried multiple time to get stronger things but i always stopped my self at the last moment. This whole time i never tried to open again to anyone again in case i get hurt again. Thats until just recently i think i just broke and stared crying one morning when the idea of just ending it came to me since i couldn't handle it anymore as im gonna be 30 soon i dont have any friends i cant talk with people heck even to girls as i don't even know how to flirt or when someone tries to i cant form any kind of connection even my parent its only the bare minimum that i communicate with them that i only have $600 to my name only just working a part time and that i have let my self that i have no motivation at all to even do something i dont even go out since its only been work home get high sleep repeat day after day i just don't know what to do or even move forward as the whole time iv been writing this my hands have been shaking i've been crying and every single atom in my body is telling me to delete this forget and keep going with how i am as it my problem and its only for me to know. i need help",throwaway75669976,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oco8tj/i_dont_know_what_to/,posted r lifeadvice posting felt bit shoulder maybe let help dont know felt good bring honestly even know point even start beginning would best choice gonna long starter im male childhood parent argued deal dad acholic going bar mom could find left neighbor got back work always arguing mom constant fighting violence time went dad starting cheating arguing got worst year went could say issue relationship come back either remember quite parent argued siting quietly argued sat kitchen whole time saw whole time since lived single apartment privacy since wa kitchen bathroom living room bedroom thought good everything would ok every time tried something either bad stander either wa dumb lazy live expectation wa disappointment follow punished felt like shit life year went went 3 separation since wanted work honestly think want lone live away family since everyone life different country got jr year highschool met felt wa ray sunshine want lose made self promised parent moving forward graduated dad stopped health problem acholic tried fixed problem got college wa still since wa time really felt happy wa wa side moved together wa moon someone loved felt wa home found making enough talked came would work full time went school worked part time wa done would turn finish took 3 job 1full 2 part could pull thru together made could could one full day 1 evening every week mind since loved thought every thing wa ok u one day told wa pregnant got excited since vowed better dad ha happy every month since wa one month closer meet daughter day cam wa giving birth whole time wa labour wa worried happy whole serious emotion cant really put paper explain wa told given birth wa holding ran room thats saw wasnt kid skin color match anyone would look asked courage wa mine answer even turn know happen week went drank even hated kind alcohol since reminded dad past promised self would die ever even trying time parent better stopped fighting everything made completely called said trouble life told go live since one else since never told never told happen since wa 3 always told never talk people private tell happens inside house private people need know since business know maybe could never open anyone completely guy asked knew little everything since wa driven head like religious scripture 6 year ha passed told one whole time felt like auto pilot tried fill gap anything ever strength move forward parent never thought something wa wrong since depression happen happy since saw smiling laughing mind set thought felt wa normal end got addicted smoking weed taking edible since wa fastest could get time feel anything wa wa high tried multiple time get stronger thing always stopped self last moment whole time never tried open anyone case get hurt thats recently think broke stared cry one morning idea ending came since handle anymore im gonna 30 soon dont friend cant talk people heck even girl even know flirt someone try cant form kind connection even parent bare minimum communicate 600 name working part time let self motivation even something dont even go since work home get high sleep repeat day day know even move forward whole time iv writing hand shaking cry every single atom body telling delete forget keep going problem know need help,dont know,5733,19
My depression (30F) has affected my relationship with my brother (27M),"Throughout my life, I have suffered depression. I have had two suicidal attempts that landed me in hospital my late teens and early 20s. Since I was 24, my depression manifested itself as PMDD, meaning that I get severely depressed on the two weeks prior to my period each month. I cry uncontrollably and get suicidal thoughts. Honestly, it’s beyond my control. I’ve always loved my younger brother and give him regular gifts, encouragement and attention. We generally connect by having intellectual debates and discussions. However, as a result of my mood fluctuations, he is often rude and distant. He’s expressed to me that ‘everything that has happened over the years has led him to act this way towards me even though he loves me. He often wished he had a ‘normal sibling’. I know this is my fault but it still hurts me. I’m 30 and while people tell me I’m attractive and intelligent, I have completely avoided romantic relationships due to fear of a potential partner seeing my depressive episodes and the ‘real me’. Consequently, i have placed a lot of importance on the relationship with my brother and It hurts me because he doesn’t place importance on it. Obviously, it’s my fault for being depressed. I feel lonely and often think that perhaps ending my life would be a good solution, that way my brother doesn’t need to see my mood fluctuations and can go on and live his life happily. I know that’s not the best solution but it does cross my mind.

Deep down I feel like I deserve this,"I probably would've tried to kill myself already if I didn't think I actually deserved to be in pain. Self-loathing isn't logical, unfortunately, and I thought I broke out of this line of thinking, basically by coming to the conclusion that no one deserves anything: people suffer for no reason. 

But I didn't. I don't know if it's my brain cobbling together a thought process to keep me breathing or not, but deep down I genuinely feel like a monster, just a fundamentally negative force in the world. My soul is black and rotting inside of me.

"Why do I let myself start the spiral, every time?","I know that every time I look at the cost of housing, specifically of what it would take to afford my own home so I didn't have to live in a shit hole apartment anymore, it just starts me on this spiral of looking at more and more places to live and feeling more and more priced out of everything. It makes me feel awful and powerless every time, like nothing is worth doing because I can't end up where I want to in life anyway. And yet, I can't stop myself. Every single time.

I just wasted my whole evening after getting off of work doing absolutely nothing because I felt too terrible and exhausted and tired and mentally fatigued to actually start doing anything fun with my night.

Birthdays are the worst - wouldn't it be great to end it all full circle?,"So, I've always loved my birthday. Which is today, btw. Always loved it, as an only child with a lovely childhood, the antecipation was always huge to receive gifts, invite my friends to party with me and the feeling that I was the most important and loved person on that day.
Then I grew up and started to realize birthdays only matter for yourself. The world doesn't stop and for everyone else is just another day, just like their birthdays are for you. Fine, I got used to it. Still with great expectations but more used to it.
Then I lost my mom. Yesterday I got chills thinking about how I spent my last birthday with her 11 years ago. 16th and 17th I was in the hospital visiting her. This is the first birthday without my dad too, he died a few months ago.
I tried to host a dinner party for my best friends only, guess what? Only one available, the other two are on vacation.
In my native language we don't use the translation for ""happy birthday"" that often, instead we say what translates to ""congratulations"", which I always found funny because congratulations for what? The earth moving for another year? For not killing yourself so far? Well, this year I found it particularly ironic because I really really really don't feel like being alive anymore.

Just another fun fact, not like it's a reason or whatever, just something I remember often: my favourite poet killed herself on her birthday.

Screaming on the inside,"For over a year I know I’ve had depression. It was never too bad, some moments were darker than others, but I managed through as my life seemed to clear up after a hard start to 2020. At the beginning of 2021, my partner and I started fresh as we relocated for his work - an exciting new chapter that I was so pumped for. A fresh start and new hope. Only it doesn’t feel that way.

7 months on and I constantly feel alone and isolated. I don’t have any real, true friends (or any for that matter) and the only people I do know feel more like acquaintances, just surface level relationships that have been formed since the change of area. I don’t talk to family much either. I’ve never had many friends and have struggled finding like minded people. At the beginning of 2020 I had a falling out with a high school best friend which has since never been repaired (although hard at the time, it was for the better). I’ve now just recently gone through another rough patch with my only friend of the last 1.5 years and don’t see it surviving long term.

I now just feel that no one has a genuine interest in me so I hold my cards close. I hardly reveal how I am really feeling. Everything mostly feels like an act. If asked how I am, it’s easier to say I’m fine than burden someone with my emotions. I’m always one to help others  during tough times, but when it comes to myself, my struggles feel insignificant and a waste of time to explain to someone. So, I suffer in silence. 
Only this just begins a catalyst of emotions that constantly fill my mind. I don’t have a life direction, no career mapped out. I have no qualifications backing me and work is always inconsistent. I’m always beating myself up that I could be better, achieve more, 
be a thriving human being instead of someone who doesn’t even understand themselves anymore. I feel so deep in a spiral and I don’t know where it’s headed. I’ve lost all confidence and feel scared to speak up in fear of rejection or social humiliation. 
Not even my partner knows the extent of how I’m feeling, probably not even at all. I’m good at hiding my bad days and he’s never seen when I’m truly struggling and having a breakdown. I’ve gone to the shops to sit in the car for an hour and cry or wait to be alone. I do everything to appear okay but I know inside I’m screaming and pulling my hair out. I feel so empty and emotionless despite having so much care and love for others. I don’t know what I want to achieve by writing this. I guess it’s a way to be heard in a world that I feel so tiny in.",gamerrgrill,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ocuzi7/screaming_on_the_inside/,year know depression wa never bad moment darker others managed life seemed clear hard start 2020 beginning 2021 partner started fresh relocated work exciting new chapter wa pumped fresh start new hope feel way 7 month constantly feel alone isolated real true friend matter people know feel like acquaintance surface level relationship formed since change area talk family much either never many friend struggled finding like minded people beginning 2020 falling high school best friend ha since never repaired although hard time wa better recently gone another rough patch friend last 1 5 year see surviving long term feel one ha genuine interest hold card close hardly reveal really feeling everything mostly feel like act asked easier say fine burden someone emotion always one help others tough time come struggle feel insignificant waste time explain someone suffer silence begin catalyst emotion constantly fill mind life direction career mapped qualification backing work always inconsistent always beating could better achieve thriving human instead someone even understand anymore feel deep spiral know headed lost confidence feel scared speak fear rejection social humiliation even partner know extent feeling probably even good hiding bad day never seen truly struggling breakdown gone shop sit car hour cry wait alone everything appear okay know inside screaming pulling hair feel empty emotionless despite much care love others know want achieve writing guess way heard world feel tiny,screaming inside,2549,23

Feel like I’m in Groundhog Day,"I’m in a situation where my life kinda sucks and just feels like it’s on repeat. I’m in the military, joined to go and seek cool shit but instead I’m stuck languishing in not that great a place in a pointless job with few options out. I don’t have much of a social life, everybody I know just gets drunk or plays video games in their free time and I’m just not about it but my base sucks for pretty much everything I like to do. Pretty much I do the same things every day and have for over 2 years and I’ve been in and out of being depressed because of it. Nothing in my life bring me any satisfaction and I’ve nothing to show for it. Unfortunately it’s just not easy to get out of where I’m at. Can’t change jobs and I have zero control over where I’m stationed selling my ass to the military for another 4 years with minimal guarantee it’ll be that much better. 
My big ambition within the military is also my best option out of here without waiting years to just get out. But it requires a lot of effort. I’ve failed at it twice. I’ve been trying to go again but I’ve just been starting to train just for some bs to come up and me to get me to get depressed and unmotivated again. 
It’s a really frustrating catch 22 where to get out of this rut where I’m depressed and hate my life it requires first not being depressed and hating my life.

Venting my swirling feelings,"Having a good day seems like a long-gone concept. My partner of 9 years is starting to hate me. He blames me for things I can't seem to control because of the mental fog from my depression. I just don't ""get"" things sometimes and he claims it's because I don't give a shit about him and anything else is an excuse. He told me last week that I had ruined the relationship and this was ""the beginning of the end."" So why the fuck should I try anymore?

My sister, the one person I trusted to love me unconditionally and always have my back, died this year. I'm just tired of trying. I told my partner during a few fights that I feel like killing myself and he told me it made him disgusted with me. I just want something to take all the pain away. I nearly jumped in front of a car last month in desperation to get away. I have no one who could just give me a hug and make me feel wanted and loved. I have no hope for the future. Honestly the only reason I don't kill myself is I can't find a good way to do it. I tried overdosing three times last year and failed. I can't even get dying right.

I messed up at my job. I hate myself. I hate my social anxiety. I wanna die,"I always regret things I said or didn't say. If I get fired I know I won't be able to defend myself while asking for a second chance, I know that I will be regretting the things I said and the things I should've said afterwards. I feel like I messed up everything at my job for not speaking enough. I just got out of a meeting and I feel like I'm falling behind at work. I have more than a year in this job and I feel stuck doing the same tasks since I started working because I just can't communicate what I'm struggling with. I can't believe how slow my growth has been compared to my new colleages. During the review meetings I'm the one with the least amount of tasks assigned and I feel terrible.

And It's mostly my fault because I have been stuck on this thing for a year and I haven't communicated what I'm going through. No one has offered a critique tho about my poor communication skills tho. I go blank, anxious, nervous, my mouth is not connected to my brain appearantly. In one of these review meetings, my supervisor asked us which one of us (me and my coworkers) was going to take care of a new assigment and I remained silent feeling paralyzed overthinking asking myself ""What if I get stuck again with this new task and can't communicate my struggles? I don't want to delay more stuff"" and as I was thinking some other colleage took that assigment away from me.

And then the meeting was over and I didn't know what to say I was shocked at myself. I'm trying my best to get rid of these tasks on my own because I simply can't speak up and ask for help most of the time. But it's terrible dealing with this on my own. I'm almost finished with these tasks I've been dealing with for a year, but damn I hate myself for not having more tasks and falling behind because of this sweatyness, stuttering, this lump in my throat everytime I try to speak, this lack of intelligence, my unability to speak correctly and make sense.

DAY 2 of doing the right thing,"I guess I'll just link my first post here in case anyone reads and wants to know any backstory:

https://old.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/obwlql/day_1/

I just took my first dose of the new medication that my psychiatrist prescribed.  I am on Abilify-- she wants me to take a quarter of my 10mg (so 2.5mg) for about a week and then slowly increase little by little.  I am VERY nervous because I had so many side effects from Latuda when I first started it-- the worst thing was the akathisia!

I went to work today and afterwards, went to a meeting with my local community garden.  Afterwards, a couple of us were invited to one of the lady's houses to see her home garden and to have some wine on her front porch.  On the drive over, I was just thinking to myself that even though I REALLY wanted to find an excuse to not go, I NEED to force myself to do things like this to invest in my future happier self.  

I like one of the ladies more than the rest-- she's more my age and she just seems really friendly.  Today, when it was just the two of us on the porch at one point, we were both laughing at ourselves because we BOTH confessed that we thought about bailing because we feel so socially awkward and, it just so happens that we both didn't want to be rude and decline the host's wine (I don't know her reasons and she sure as hell doesn't know mine haha) but I actually DID decline and got a water instead.  It wasn't a big thing at all but I am so fucking proud of myself for not having a drink-- normally I would find this to be the perfect excuse to cheat.  But dude, it's DAY 2, I can't do that to myself already!  I also haven't smoked weed even though it is all RIGHT there and my partner is smoking tonight.  

So I just wanted to say that tonight, I feel a little hopeful.  I am proud of myself for doing the right things today.  I really hope that I can keep it up-- I really need to give this a real shot.  I'm so sick of feeling depressed.  I hope at least that the Abilify doesn't make me sick or uncomfortable tonight!",thots_n_prayers,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ocn5zb/day_2_of_doing_the_right_thing/,guess link first post case anyone read want know backstory http old reddit com r depression comment obwlql day_1 took first dose new medication psychiatrist prescribed abilify want take quarter 10mg 2 5mg week slowly increase little little nervous many side effect latuda first started worst thing wa akathisia went work today afterwards went meeting local community garden afterwards couple u invited one lady house see home garden wine front porch drive wa thinking even though really wanted find excuse go need force thing like invest future happier self like one lady rest age seems really friendly today wa two u porch one point laughing confessed thought bailing feel socially awkward happens want rude decline host wine know reason sure hell know mine haha actually decline got water instead big thing fucking proud drink normally would find perfect excuse cheat dude day 2 already also smoked weed even though right partner smoking tonight wanted say tonight feel little hopeful proud right thing today really hope keep really need give real shot sick feeling depressed hope least abilify make sick uncomfortable tonight,day 2 right thing,2045,30

how to make family understand,"i literally typed so damn fucking much and i had to fucking close the tab when my mother came in why the fuck does it have to be this way

ok ill say it all over again. pls read this someone this is one of my last hopes left

i am 14 years old and i have been extremely depressed for 8 months now. basically i am depressed and i am unabel to study or take a shower or eat properly or anything and i asked my parents to bring me to a psychatrist and i got diagnosed and got meds but just because i wasnt eating properly my parents made me stop it. my parents keep forcing me to study and to do things that a normal person woudl do but they dont understand that i am unabe to do anything and i have suffered so mch already but they are still not understanding. my mom thinks m faking it just becuse i am able to shout at her to stop telling me to do stuff that i am ubale to do. my dad is a little more supportive but thats of no use because i have expainied to my parents countless times what i am feeling but they still dont think theres anything wrong with me. a few days ago i tried to die ( i have been extremely suicidal for a long time now) by slitting my wrists but ha ha it failed and here i am now but my parenst foudn out but they still cannot understand that i am trying to die. so with nothing else left i asked my dad to bring me to the mental hospital/psych ward but he shouted at me and told me that only insane people go there and insisted that there's nothing wrong with me while i have been dying so much for so long. pls understand what i am saying pls i really cannot take this i swear i am not exaggerating or faking it. its really bad and i litereally have a 50+ page google document of my suffering and i only started it on April. its the only place where i record my feelings adn stuff. i cannot show that to my parents because i have already told them all the things i have been feeling. to my parents it just looks like i am  having fun or something because tehy keep telling me to 'come out of it' and to focus on my studies because i  only watch my phone or use the laptop but its actually me deseparately trying to distract myself. and my father actually scolded me for watching youtube and making some lame memes and basically for doing all the things that have been saving me for so long. 

now theres nothing else left for me to do otehr than to die. and hoepfully ill do it on the day i have decided to do it. theres no way i will be able to go to the mental hospital/psych ward by myself. my parents are trying to help me but they are doing t in the wrong ways and only end up making it worse. i honestly dont know wha to do. someone help me.",birdgirl1507,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ocqkwr/how_to_make_family_understand/,literally typed damn fucking much fucking close tab mother came fuck doe way ok ill say pls read someone one last hope left 14 year old extremely depressed 8 month basically depressed unabel study take shower eat properly anything asked parent bring psychatrist got diagnosed got med wasnt eating properly parent made stop parent keep forcing study thing normal person woudl dont understand unabe anything suffered mch already still understanding mom think faking becuse able shout stop telling stuff ubale dad little supportive thats use expainied parent countless time feeling still dont think anything wrong day ago tried die extremely suicidal long time slitting wrist ha ha failed parenst foudn still cannot understand trying die nothing else left asked dad bring mental hospital psych ward shouted told insane people go insisted nothing wrong dying much long pls understand saying pls really cannot take swear exaggerating faking really bad litereally 50 page google document suffering started april place record feeling adn stuff cannot show parent already told thing feeling parent look like fun something tehy keep telling come focus study watch phone use laptop actually deseparately trying distract father actually scolded watching youtube making lame meme basically thing saving long nothing else left otehr die hoepfully ill day decided way able go mental hospital psych ward parent trying help wrong way end making worse honestly dont know wha someone help,make family understand,2675,29

I feel lifeless, no direction. It felt like a self-fulfilling prophecy or self sabotage I guess because I ended up dropping out and becoming a NEET for real.

Don't know how to proceed. Is something wrong with me? I don't know, beside depression. I feel like I'm not suitable to live, maintaining self-care is a chore, taking a bath feels like a chore. I read comics to escape my reality, staying in bed for hours and days. 

I crave social interactions but I don't have inherent values to people, do I. Unless you're functional person, I don't think anyone wants anything to do with you do they? Mental health is only important if it magically turns you to a person capable of self sustaince (holding a job, home making etc). Even I don't think I'm that bad in the terms of being depressed, but I still go periodically for weeks just focusing on escaping reality. Useless, useless person.

"Why the fuck is it so hard, if not often impossible to make real life friends?","First and foremost, outside of school, there's almost nowhere for teenagers or young adults to meet people around their age. And in school, everyone sticks to their groups, with seemingly no intention of branching out. You can't just approach someone who's walking, talking, or sitting with their friends and ask to hang out and be taken seriously. If you just randomly follow or add people on Instagram or Snapchat, most guys will be seen as creepy or weird. Even if you somehow manage to meet someone, half the time they're an asshole, a quarter of the time they're dull and have nothing of substance to say, and only the last 25% are actually cool people.

My great grandpa died this week,"Hey guys.

I’ve been in therapy for 8 years now. Round about. Maybe more.
This week Thursday my great grandpa died. I didn’t have a close Connection to him, to be fair, I didn’t have a connection to him at all.
But with all the stuff going on with my dad and my grandma (not to go in detail with this), a full generation of my family just vanished and all this crap happening. I’m just down. 
I don’t know what to do. It’s dragging me so down again, I’m at a low point in my life again. My therapist seems to hate me or is at least bored by my stories so I really can’t go to her.
I don’t know, im so confused by myself.
And honestly, I don’t know what I mean or what I need.
Maybe some nice words.

Im(f15) homesick,"So, my(f15) mom decided to take me and my brother(m18) to this really beautiful place with a bunch of trees and just really amazing scenery. I’m a pretty outdoorsy person and I absolutely adore nature so I thought that I’d have a really great time. We drove up here today, it was a long drive and I get car sick so it wasn’t super fun for me, I mostly just slept. Well, not only did my mom, me, and my brother come. A bunch of other people also came like my moms boyfriend, his sister, his kids, his ex wife, his wife’s brother, and three other people I don’t really know how they’re related at all. I have pretty bad social anxiety, it doesn’t take very much to drain my social battery. I’ve always gotten home sick, on sleepovers or anything like that. I don’t want to be ungrateful because I know this trip must be expensive and I’m very grateful to my mom for providing us with such an awesome opportunity!

I've Relapsed/Hit the Wall Again,"As the title says, I'm feeling it slip.

I've been dealing with Anxiety and at one point Clinical Depression for a lot of my life. And a few years ago, I had a moment of actualization where I hated who I was and knew I had to change. So I spent a year examining what it was I hated about myself and another 2 years and continuing afterwards to actively try to change. I thought I had made so much progress with all the effort I had put forward.

And today I've relapsed back to square one.

For context, I did something I've felt guilt over back then. I prioritized a romantic interest over my best friends and made them feel discarded. I apologized afterwards, but during my self-analysis that was one of the main points I wanted to change most. To make sure my friends knew I cared about them and to not make them feel optional.

So I tried. I tried to keep more in contact, keep myself in check whenever I saw habits of leaving someone in the dark, etc. For anyone who relates, you know just how much effort that requires from someone who's fighting everyday by themselves already. For someone who naturally pushes people away because of the walls you put up. It was hard.

And today I found out I made the same friend feel the same way all over again. This time, prioritizing another friendship over ours. And I just...shutdown. I made the same mistake, the same scenario. Even with all the effort put forward.

It's selfish, I know. I hurt them, so why am I the one hurting right now? But I can't help it. I can't help but think that the last few years of effort were pointless. That I spent over 1000 days to just end up exactly where I started. And the worst part is? They don't even deny it. They know I'm still at that square. Some part of me, some selfish part, just wanted to hear that I did make progress. That I'm not the same person I was back then. That it was just a mistake or slip up that could happen from a miscommunication and that it's no big deal. But they didn't say that. They said to try a new approach. That I just need to be more aware. That I do a lot of things that irk them, but they let it pass because we've known each other for a long time.  That they forgive me.

That last part hurts the most. They forgive me. Again.

I'm just...so tired. Tired of everything really. Of trying. Of expecting things to be different on the next go. Of being forgiven.

My friend doesn't care about me anymore.,"For anyone who reads this, I want to be completely honest with me. So I have a friend, E that I've known since I was in elementary school. In 8th grade, her and her sister moved away and I didn't hear from them again for 6 years. I finally got to contact them after 6 years. Her sister wasn't interested in talking to me at all, despite her sister being the one who I hung out with the most. So me and E stayed friends pretty much, while her sister did her thing.

Fast forward nearly a year later. So everytime I've suggested or asked to meet up with E to finally see her 6 years later, she said it wouldn't work out because her foster parents don't want her hanging out with older people. I didn't really push it past that. So many months after we became friends again, her and her boyfriend broke up. My best friend then suggested I date E, which I kinda did consider but I still found the whole idea too weird to really do. My friend then proceeds to flirt with E, and they go from there. Aaaand they started talking about meeting up to hookup, etc. I'm starting to get really annoyed because I've literally known her my whole life and haven't seen her in years, and everytime I've asked to see her if was always some excuse of why she can't, but then when they want to meet up and hookup and all that, it's no problem as long as their sneaky about it.

 I got annoyed to the point I deleted the group chat. E and her friends noticed the reason why. Now, E is the type of person where, if she knows something bothers you, she will keep doing it infront of you to get a reaction. This is exactly what she kept on doing, even taunting me, saying she'll fuck my friends. I made sure not to show it this time, but it just got me more annoyed. Now shes on the phone waaaay later than she ever was with me with my friends, wanting to meet up, all that. Now I just feel like I've been completely replaced, like she doesn't even care for me anymore. Ontop of this, my friend has a girlfriend, yet he's still flirting and all that with E anyways. E knows he has a girlfriend, yet that doesn't seem to stop either of them anyways.

Can someone please be upfront and honest with me and tell me if I'm over reacting?

"I'm not enthusiastic about anything anymore, and I feel guilty for it.","I'm 13F which i guess is a bit young to be complaining about how I'm feeling about life but i can't really just let it bottle up anymore, so here goes. I was diagnosed with clinical depression about a year and a half-two years ago, and I recently have had trouble with being enthusiastic about life or just enjoying the things i used to, like shows that used to mean so much to me mean so little now. I'll often convince myself I'm excited for something, but I'm really not anymore. It's all just ""this is happening and I'm gonna be there."" I'd rather not go back on medication because I'd rather be truly happy rather than have a drug make me feel like I am. More personally I'm figuring out my sexuality and I know that I like girls, so I have to think about this constantly since if my family found out it wouldn't be very easy for me.

Terrified that this is my last shot,"I’ve struggled with major depression since I was in my teens. I’m in the late 30s now, and maybe worse than ever. Early this week I was admitted to a residential treatment program. I’ll be here for 30 days. I’m hopeful - it’s pretty intensive, 5 hours of therapy a day (a mix of individual and group) as well as other care - bloodwork, medication management with a physicist, and other things like yoga, mindfulness, learning coping skills, etc. So far it’s been good, but hard. Not that I didn’t expect that. 

It’s a strange feeling being here. I’m glad for the treatment, and for having the basics handled for me - meals, schedule, giving meds at the right time - things I was having a very hard time with on my own. This week is the first week in a year and a half that I have eaten more than one meal a day.  But there are constant reminders that I’m here because I can’t be trusted on my own. We’re supervised 24/7, all our belongings are searched - both upon arrival and randomly each day. We have to take a breathalyzer once a day, and there are random drug screenings (I came back to my room today after afternoon group with a cup on my sink for me to pee in. Fun!) Meds are handed out under supervision. Things like my razor have to be locked up, and checked out to use. It’s both comforting and humiliating. I am a grow-ass adult who has to be monitored like a toddler. 

I’d been using alcohol and weed to numb myself the last few months, and while my drinking was never (quantity-wise) a problem, the way I was using it definitely was, and having nothing to take that edge off is ROUGH. I’m glad I don’t have that crutch right now, but man what I wouldn’t give for one drink right now. Or to just get nice and baked. Best I can do right now is a cup of herbal tea and a walk around the yard. 

The thing is, what scares me most is that I’ll go home, and I’ll just go back to my miserable existence. And then I don’t know what I’ll do. Well I do. I can’t go through this again. It’s agony. It’s excruciating.  And if I don’t find relief, then I’m done. What if I’m beyond repair? In my first check in with my therapist here, she asked something to the effect of, why are you here? And I told her honestly that it feels like I have no choice. I’m at complete rock bottom and I don’t know what else to do. 

Life for me has been just a series of distractions to get from one day to the next. I have no purpose. I feel invisible. I could go on, but I’m sick of talking about how fucked up I am. I need this to work, otherwise I’m done. I can’t suffer like this anymore.",whydenytheobvious,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ocsmwb/terrified_that_this_is_my_last_shot/,struggled major depression since wa teen late 30 maybe worse ever early week wa admitted residential treatment program 30 day hopeful pretty intensive 5 hour therapy day mix individual group well care bloodwork medication management physicist thing like yoga mindfulness learning coping skill etc far good hard expect strange feeling glad treatment basic handled meal schedule giving med right time thing wa hard time week first week year half eaten one meal day constant reminder trusted supervised 24 7 belonging searched upon arrival randomly day take breathalyzer day random drug screening came back room today afternoon group cup sink pee fun med handed supervision thing like razor locked checked use comforting humiliating grow adult ha monitored like toddler using alcohol weed numb last month drinking wa never quantity wise problem way wa using definitely wa nothing take edge rough glad crutch right man give one drink right get nice baked best right cup herbal tea walk around yard thing scare go home go back miserable existence know well go agony excruciating find relief done beyond repair first check therapist asked something effect told honestly feel like choice complete rock bottom know else life ha series distraction get one day next purpose feel invisible could go sick talking fucked need work otherwise done suffer like anymore,terrified last shot,2578,35

Staying alive for trivial things (again),"This is not the first time I've been here.

Years ago, the only thing keeping me alive was waiting for the finale of my favorite TV show. A year or so afterwards, I had my first suicide attempt.

It's funny cus not too long ago, I finally felt that the world was my oyster. I thought I built a great resume for my dream job and that I finally found a therapist who really cared and was on my side.

Here's what's keeping me alive lately, and I'm scared:

- Animal Crossing (video game)

- My Chihuahua is the only innocence left in the world.

- Once I'm able to quit my job (when?), I can self-medicate with weed and shrooms. (Fuck these antidepressants.)

- My home decorating is a WIP. I'm proud of what I've done so far and want to finish the vision.

What's killing me:

- The financial pressure. For the first time in my life, I'm experiencing financial security. I can't bear the thought of going back to where I was, no matter how unbearable it feels to work in this mental state.

- The daily pressures. Everything little demand makes me freeze or cry. I have PTSD from sexual abuse. Do you think anyone has ever given me a free pass for my suffering? Nope. Suck it up, buttercup, you have responsibilities (to others...)

- Nobody gives a shit. I'm a bleeding heart, I love to connect with people deeply. But I can't do that anymore because everyone just judges. People say they want to help, then say stupid shit, like ""first, you've gotta help yourself."" Ok, thanks, like I'm not already putting all the energy I have into NOT fucking exploding. Even with therapists, you can never be truly open. There are scripts we have to play. I am truly alone, it's true.

“Any Big Plans For The Weekend?”,"I know I’m posting this at a bad time because of the holiday weekend, but it’s been an ongoing theme for years now. Does anyone else get anxiety when they hear this question or “how was your weekend?“ or “any big plans for the weekend?” 

I have no friends; anything that I do is by myself and I have to find my own fun. If that doesn’t happen (which 99% of the time it doesn’t because no one asks me to do anything with them and their friends), I stay home and do things to keep myself busy. 

So these questions are so uncomfortable to me because the answer for afterwards is always “I just had a relaxing weekend.” The answer to the other side is “I’m not sure yet, we’ll see what comes up.” I have to make something up to make myself feel and sound like not such a loser and raise eyebrows, or just try to avoid it entirely. 

It’s gotten to a point where I can’t even imagine anyone wanting to invite me to something where they have to spend quality time and deal with me. Happy hours are different because, typically, there are a lot of people there so you try to socialize with everyone. But someone inviting you over to their house for a get-together on the weekend might entail a smaller group and then for hours in a row, they need to interact with you. I just can’t see how they would want to put up with that. 

It just doesn’t make sense to me why or how anyone would want to burden themselves with having to see me by their own will. I’m just tolerated in the times and places I need to be. ‘Just interact as much as you need to to satisfy him and get him to go away.’ To them, I think I’m just a nuisance.

I don't think I'm cut out for this world.,"I'm Canadian and I spent Canada Day home alone. I was going to walk down the street to see the fireworks but I have a hemorrhoid so bad that I can barely move. Just one of many hilarious ways the universe is trying to tell me I don't belong here. Dramatic? Sadly this grumpy asshole of mine is the least of my troubles. My cat isn't doing so well these days and I don't think he's going to make it to the end of the year. My alcoholic father is in the hospital after years of defying the odds and my mother isn't too far behind him with her own health issues. I had my heart broken last December and I've still not recovered from it. Nothing but women troubles since then and I realized yesterday that every person that I love and adore hates me and wants nothing to do with me. The few friends that I have try their best to be cool about it but I'm such a fuck up everytime I go out with them. This shitty ass year is only half way over and I can feel it in my core that the worst is yet to come. I feel so defeated despite overcoming a close call with suicide a couple months ago. I'm trying, I really am but I feel like every effort I make to prosper is met with nothing but resistance from the universe. If I'm being punished I'm struggling to understand what for. I've already paid for my mistakes 10x over and shit just continues to crumble around me. I've always had humble ambitions yet I've failed at every turn to meet such a low bar.

I wasn't able to play in person during the pandemic and playing on the computer just isnt the same, ao i was ecstatic when i got vaccinated and stores opened back up.

But somethings wrong, losing isnt fun anymore. If i lose i feel defeated, drained. Im leaving events early when i can no longer win prizes. Even finishing the night at a 50% win rate makes me want to go home and put a shotgun in my mouth.

But I dont even feel that bad besides magic. I got a new job, its going well, video games are fun, im generally happy. But the only thing I want to do during my nights is enjoy magic again and I cant. 

I dont know how to fix it either. I tell myself you have to just stay positive, take the hits, dont let the loss get you down and have fun. But when the first loss of the night comes, boom, im down all night.

If I were to end it….,"Part of me almost enjoys the idea of the bickering and conversations/arguments my family and friends would have of me with me gone. What they did wrong. Questioning their own sanity. Who’s to blame. They’d realize all their own bullshit as well as finally recognizing my own heaping pile of it without making up excuses fir me of why I’m not succeeding in adulthood yet. They’d all wonder why they didn’t do more. My message would b. We’re all fucked. None of this is going to work. This is as far as this generation is going to go. Humans need to die. We’re done. 
Not really with the pain though. Would almost just wish it was like I was still hanging out at home doing nothing in their minds rather than dead and gone. Like what oh NOW you’re sad?! NOW you feel something. You should’ve been sad a long time ago. 
Am I entitled. Am I selfish/self absorbed? Do I want attention? Am I too needy? Unreliable? Maybe. I just can’t figure this out. Online is too scary for me. In person is too scary fir me. I can’t trust anyone. Close relatives Nagging me about why I haven’t gotten together with people would apparently be great to hang out with or have common interests. 
I just don’t want to. I don’t like people. I can’t fucking stand the talking. I’m so fucking tired of saying how good a meal was each and every time. Or saying wow cool story or that’s interesting. Or asking questions like I’m interested. 
It’s a privilege to be here. Almost like  I’m the biggest Moocher this world has ever known. I’m just a leech. A fuckin parasite. 
That’s why I need to go. And maybe all need to go too. But let’s just focus on me now. Don’t worry I’m not likely to do anything. Rarely do I ever act on an idea. I’m just a fucking nightmare. An emotional sand trap. The worst though is when I biologically get a boost because I’m still designed as a human to need social interaction so naturally in the brief moments of connecting with people it seems like I’m enjoying something or that there is good in the world. So I actually think I’m feeling better and that I’m normal and it’ll all work out. But all it does is make me weaker. Makes me believe for a second that there’s hope or something to hold onto. All it does is extend your life. Gives reason to not end this misery sooner. Distractions. it’s not what I think or feel on my own. When the dust settles and I feel the weight in my own shoes. Away from the bells and whistles. It’s all darkness.

I need back on my antidepressants,A couple months ago. My prescription ran out. I kept procrastinating on going to the doctor cause of COVID and the fact that I just moved and I’ve never had to find a doctor on my own. And I used the blue cross blue shield app to get my prescription filled and they said I couldn’t just keep doing the online visits to get my prescription renewed. So my meds ran out. And I felt fine for a while. I was doing well with my mindfulness exercises a counselor once taught me to help. But my dad has cancer and the things are piling up. And I’m reverting. Every dang thing I had problems with are coming back. And I’m really afraid to tell my wife. I don’t know why because I trust her and I love her. I just can’t tell her. And I can’t schedule a doctors appointment because I’m afraid to go back on the medicine even though it was helping.

Why am I still here?,"This year I turned 29, moved me and my fiancé out to LA for a new start...  Before moving to LA I've always had this thought that I should have died young. I tried to take my life a few times when I was a teenager but survived every attempt... It was kind of like God showing his sense of humor. You see as a child I was abused, molested, bullied, kicked out of my home quite often and always treated like I was a bad kid (i was actually a straight A student and kept to myself) 

I just got so tired of the abuse at home and being bullied at school so I started praying to god, asking him if he'd take me and just end my suffering. I prayed every night. Then to make matters worse I started to become attracted to other guys. I was told many times that liking the same sex is a sin and that those kinds of people go straight to hell. When I started liking guys I figured I was gonna go to hell anyway so I decided to try to take my life. I came very close to being dead a few times but was saved every time.

I really wish I would've died... My life has continued to be awful and I've continued to be alone. Everyone I cared about has either died or left (moved away. I understand other people have their own problems, goal and dreams) I'm still poor and I always have to keep a mask on showing that I'm happy. I always have to be the strong person because that's what people think of me. They call me for advice, they talk to me about their problems but never return the favor. I have absolutely no one who understands how much I am hurting. I keeping hurting and keep going but I don't know why. I'm just very tired and I'm not even sure why I'm still alive.

I recently just got a new summer job at a restaurant, and all my co workers are girls. I have Asbergers, so not only am I already awkward, but I lack any sort of common sense, so I tend to mess up a lot when it comes to the work I’ve been doing. I’ve been working here for like a month, and I feel like everyday I mess something up. I’ve been trying so hard to make a good impression on these people so that maybe I could actually make some friends for once, but now I’m getting the impression that they’re starting to either hate me or I annoy them. The reason why is honestly due to the fact that not only do they laugh around me when I walk in to work now, but they also never talk to me much when I try and talk to them. I’m just so over this crap. This literally happens every social situation or event I get into, and I’m so tired of it.

"I have plenty of reason to live, but for some reason I don't want to.","I love a lot of things in this world and at one point I had potential to do some great stuff. But I feel like that opportunity is gone now, I've been lazy and depressed for the past 4 years. I'm leaving university and entering the world with no life skills and an education which isn't worth the det as it can't secure me a job. I've wasted my younger years and I just feel like there's no way out of this.

I feel like I have nothing to work hard for. I honestly don't care much about myself and I know I'll never amount to anything because I'm lazy. I know life isn't about achieving or materialistic things like money or expensive things. Life is about experiencing the present moment and creating your own purpose, but I've never had a purpose or dream.

I don't want to just live a life where I'm working a dead end job, so the answer is to obviously do something with myself and change that right? But for some reason I just don't have the motivation, day in and day out I tell myself how I could improve my life and be happier. Even in this moment I could go practice skills or do some voluntary work, help the homeless, I could work out, I could do fucking loads. Yet despite knowing this I'm just filled with anger and resentment against myself and life.

I honestly don't even have anything to complain about, I'm in okay health, I can walk and actually do things, I'm young, got good friends. My life is okay, the only negative is my own self destructive behaviour. I'm the problem in my own life. 

I'm even greatful for the things I have, I recognise the worth of life and beauty of nature. Yet still, for almost no reason at all I still want to sit in bed all day and fantasise about killing myself one day to finally be over with this confusing experience we call life. I just don't have any effort anymore so I feel like if I'm not ever going to do anything to fix myself then I might as well kill myself.

"Trying to keep it together after 2 years of ""being better""","I've suffered from depression off and on my whole life, for longer than I can remember. I was 8 when I first attempted suicide, when I jumped from my 2nd story bedroom window after leaving my mom a suicide note. I really thought it would work. My last serious suicide attempt was over a decade ago, in my early 20s, when I OD'd on pills on purpose and ended up in the hospital for days (and ended up with an eye twitch and other unpleasant side effects that stayed with me for 5+ years). I still have self-harm scars on my arms, but they have faded so much that they're barely noticeable, unless you look for them.

I was less suicidal but majorly depressed for most of the last decade too, though. But for the past 2 years...I've been better. I've finally been able to feel normal human emotions. I've felt ""worried"" in normal situations that I should be worried about, without feeling crippling anxiety. I've been able to feel sadness instead of complete despair and depression. I've experienced true, blissful happiness over the simplest of things, when I'm not sure I had never felt that happy before in my life.

But...things have been going bad for me the past couple of months. And I feel those old feelings slowly creeping back. I had my first suicidal thought in 2 years a couple of days ago...it was brief and passed quickly, but it scared the hell out of me, and frankly pissed me off (which is good, at least!). I'm not feeling a full-blown depression at all, but I'm starting to feel those feelings of despair. I'm in bad financial shape, been falling behind on the most basic household chores. I found myself go 2 days without a shower, which isn't something I've done in a couple of years. I'm dealing with house problems and relationship problems and a serious injury/not-so-good prognosis for a beloved pet.

I'm trying so hard to ""grab"" myself before I fall into that funk again. I've spent almost my whole 33 years of life depressed. The last 2 years have been a blessing.

Has anyone ever had an “expiration date”?,"Lately I’ve been thinking, that I wouldn’t mind dying around 60-70 years old. Like if I had a terminal illness around that time, I would just not seek treatment. Or if I’m lucky enough to be perfectly healthy I would just request to be euthanized (is that legal? Probably not). I don’t want kids and I’m not interesting or good looking enough to get married. I would just travel around the world, see what needs to be seen and just peace out. I don’t have a lot of aspirations or goals other than that. And I don’t have a lot of friends or family that I feel would really  notice my absence. And around 60-70 it’s all downhill from there anyways right? A peaceful death is much better than succumbing to Alzheimer’s or dementia, slowly losing yourself and all the memories that you’ve created.

i guess in no means life has been easy on me. i've always had anxiety, even far back to grade school when i would have panic attacks about handing in school work and having to go in for tests and quizzes. i didn't know at the time that this stemmed from the abuse i endured from my brother. in fact, i just recently found out i was abused and have barely any recollection of what happened to me. i always knew my brother had anger problems, because that was basically all anyone in my family talked about. i did not know until recently how bad it was (hitting, name calling, screaming, etc). a little bit of backstory; currently i am 18, my brother is 27, and my sister is 30. i don't have many memories of when my brother lived with us (around 2 years ago) but i do know fighting was a very prevalent thing in my life. when my mother was younger she had my brother and sister with a different, abusive man that would mistreat my mother and brother in the same way my brother mistreated me. my brothers dad never wanted him, he wanted my mom to get an abortion as soon as he knew my mom conceived. my sister was favoured by him in a very clear way. later my mom remarried and had me, at this point my brother was already knee deep in past trauma and now developing heavy anger issues. when i was born my siblings both made some sort of pact to hate me (i get it, i bet if my parents got a divorce i'd hate the new baby too). but one day my brother got mad at me and slapped me in the back of the head my sister was done with it, they got in a gigantic fight and my sister has been in my corner ever since (i was probably 3-4, and of course my brother would never hit me in front of my parents). now my sister had been moved out for probably 5 years and my brother 2. i remember having a lot of trouble when my sister left and i think i was slightly depressed (can't really remember). i always had trouble going to school but after my sister left things doubled, i stopped going to school and even if i wanted to go back i'd get so anxious about people bombarding me with questions that i just stopped going completely. i was put in therapy for my anxiety and was also prescribed escitalopram, not knowing how much my brother was effecting me and everyone sweeping that under the table. my therapist was terrible and i stopped going after 5 months (we got nowhere, he would assign me worksheets ?? if i'm not even doing school why would he expect me to do them). recently i slept over at my brothers (but before i found out he abused me) and everything was fine until the next morning. him and his girlfriend got into a huge fight over her being cranky in the morning (it was nothing big) he threw something at the tv and he was calling her names and screaming. that's been bothering me for a long time, i felt like a child being screamed at even tho it wasn't me. in the last month he's gotten a dog that he blatantly abuses in front of everyone. i want to say something so bad but i'm so scared he'll do something really bad to it or his girlfriend if he gets really pissed. i feel like him being around me in general without this already brings back trauma and this dog on top of it just makes me want to steal the dog and be able to shelter it from him. i just wanna cry seeing how scared this dog is.

now i'm still on escitalopram (which i think is not working) and am addicted to weed. before i found out about my abuse i was using moderately and now that i've found out its gotten a lot worse, same with my mental health. all i do is cry if i'm sober. i used to feel so crazy for being depressed and having anxiety before i found out about anything, i felt that way on a regular basis and i still do sometimes. now i feel like i'm becoming a hypochondriac with searching shit up on google, terrible anxiety, recently discovered adhd, and just wanting to cry all the time. my mind jumps to the next anxiety multiple times in seconds, it feels like there's constantly 40 tabs open in my head and they're all just worries. on top of this i compulsively lie about my life for no reason. i feel extreme guilt for the things i tell people and have tried so hard to stop but i'll catch myself in the middle of a story making something up not even purposely. i think i make things up to get less judgement from the person, idk. i want to be an honest person and i really want to improve. i feel like a burden to everyone around me. i guess i need some advice, i know i need to go to therapy again but my last therapist makes me worry about a new one (i know i will end up going). sometimes i don't know if i'm crazy or just traumatized from what happened. i don't think i got enough guidance because everyone that was there wanted to protect me from him and that's what everyone focused on. i need some guidance and i know this is reddit but i've never opened up to anyone this much, so i guess it's a start.

Mom just accosted me half asleep in the kitchen,"
For context I am an adult. I did need her help this year…freaking hate myself for it because I feel like I’m more indebted to her. I had a seizure and it set me back financially. I do feel I am a disgrace. That all said…

I didn’t want to even go back in the kitchen because of how tired I feel but I was thirsty. Was literally two steps away from bed. We’re leaving from a family trip tomorrow (one I did not want to go on but talk myself into every year because my parents are aging). I did a lot to help my parents pack up beforehand (I’m still a kid to them since I’m not married…I don’t mind helping but it’s a demand). 

It is nighttime and I thought I was in the clear because her light was off. She comes in the kitchen, starts at me really quick about how she needs me to do this and this and this tomorrow. I cut her off and say I’m just here to get a drink. She says excuse me (horrific tone…menacing) I say I’m here to get a drink. She says “that’s really rude.” Not a big deal if that were the end of it but she’ll carry it over to tomorrow…tell my dad…unleash everything about me that she can’t stand. My weight… (have my medicine to thank for that) my “meanness” (I’m not mean. I’m on edge around her because I never know which version I’ll get. The loving one or the one who wants to use me as her emotional punching bag). We have to drive home a long way too. I do a lot of putting up with her but nobody in the family ever sets boundaries. She walks all over my dad, siblings get to use their own families as shields and she wouldn’t dare come after them.

My brief story i guess,"Hey bois, im not gonna say my name although i dont even know why. I have always been alone since i was a small child, since i was born up until today i have always been a kind, supportive, altruistic and never cared about myself and always put others in front of me, however i learned that life doesnt give a fuck about anyone, in nursery school i was bullied for no reasons by other kids i never met, teachers didnt care and kept telling me to stop being whiny, i lived alone with my mother and i never wanted to make her worry so i never told her anything.

growing up have always been despised society (even today) people looked at me they judged me, they made fun of me and bullied me. until 1 day i met a guy that was like me, i saw nothing bad in him so i supported him and until i was 15 i had already met a handful of society rejects like myself we became great friend until i first visited England. live in england was 100x better in every single way my parents asked me if i wanted to move and me being the altruistic person that i am said yes, loosing everything i got, i was a teenager and so were my friends, today they are big popular guys and im a forgotten memory, i guess its due to the fact that i grew up alone i became a very observant person so now when i go back to my country i can see and feel that im just bothering people.

my parents only care about money and work, my mother cried and was in pain because when we came to the uk she didnt have any friends in the first 6 months same with my father, i felt the same way but because im not them they constantly criticise me for feeling what they FELT. i want some time for myself but my parents dont understand that they want to see me earning money so that i can give them more and more money (their own words btw). to be honest i secretly never wanted to work when i was a kid i would tell people i wanted to be an engineer so that noone would judge me but i always wanted to be a ""adventurer"" :) when i was a kid, now i wanted to be a hippie like live outdoors, surviving from the wilderness but im here because that makes my parents disappointed.

Today im 21 have no job (not ashamed btw i think people should take time for themselves if they can), no friends, play video games/music to cheer myself up, stream to twitch hoping i'll meet people like me or someone who might enjoy being ""near"" me, live with my parents who are disappointed in me and constantly criticise me and my spoiled sister who is always fukin up and no one teaches her what consequences are, im tired of life, society, goverment, money, religion and politics, i have thought of killing myself but the thought that would hurt people like my sister, grandma and maybe mother i would rather suffer till the end of my life than hurt them.

If you don't want to hear the truth how I feel. Then don't ask the fucking question!!,"If you don't want to hear the truth how I feel. Then don't ask the fucking question! 

So many people I left me in red after I have told them how I feel. Why ask the question if you didn't care about answer.! My so-called friends have turned their backs on me. And I knew them for 20 and 10yers. But that meant nothing apparently... 6 head surgeries in one year that was 5 years ago destroyed my life. I can only walk 700m 2 times a day I can't be in a large group of people. I wake up every morning feeling like shit. It literally feels like I have to climb Everest every day!! And I have people that have honestly told me to be happier. And they are the same people that complain over one year of being isolated. Try 5 fucking years!!!!! So don't tell me what to do when you are weaker! If I'm unlucky my life I destroyed forever. And that I never can manage a full-time job. 

One year after my surgery I did rehabilitation and studied up my Grades. I got top top grades and improved my condition at the same time. So I'm weak? Yeah fucking right. It took me 2,5 years to do it but I got it done! Went from walking 70m once a day to 500m 2 times a day 

Then when I wanted to try rehabilitation and University on 50% distance. I almost did one course. But I had to fight with the system at the same time. So I got a big backlash. Thank you society. So now I go in my walk and spend the rest of my time in bed. 

I will probably get a lot of hate for this but it can't be worse than being rejected 100 times. ( probably more I have lost count)

I need to talk about dating as an ish ugly and depressed man with health problems. My experiences with dating haven't been good. I have been rejected, block, and ignored more than I can remember. All I hear is what's wrong with me. It has gotten to the point that I now believe them... Anxiety and loneness are a part of my daily life. 
Something that is really provocative is when girls say “good boys don't exist” and I'm over here like “ yes we do but I was apparently too ugly and boring for you” I'm not going to lie I had 7 months when I wasn't lonely. I meet my first girlfriend and finally lost my virginity. The problem was that she was toxic. So I had to leave that relationship. But apparently, I was good for her because I was her first. And 2 months later she found a new one. So I did something right. The reason why she was bad for me was that she started a lot of fights and when she got upset she said some really horrible things just to put me down. When I broke up she said some nasty stuff. Now once did I say anything bad back. I even had other people reading it and I asked them If I did or say something wrong. And trust me dose people would tell me if I did something wrong. Even if that was difficult I don't regret anything. Now 2 years later I'm back to being rejected so a part of me thinks that I should have stayed. My therapist doesn't agree. 😂 

So why doesn't a man who never would take his partner for granted, be there for her when she needs you ( even after me breaking up yes I didn't ignore all here messages I answered even too all the really mean stuff) I will give you a few reasons. 1 I'm not “cool or macho” 2 I'm short 3 I don't look good 4 I'm not confident 5 I have health issues 6 I'm depressed. There we go I have given you some reasons 😂 you might say that you don't want a macho man. But if we look back to school growing up. Who got all the girls?  One thing for sure it wasn't me. What I have realized after talking to A LOT of people is the a lot of girls want a bad boy that they can turn good. My only hope is to find the few who just want a good boy. And yes I know that you girls exist. The only problem with you is that you 99% of the time already have found the love of your life. And to put a disclaimer out I'm not hating on girls I just tell you why I feel the way I do. And trust me I know I'm far from perfect. But I will be there for you 24/7 even if I have mad anxiety, I will never take you for granted and I will tell you regularly that you are my light in this dark tunnel and that I'm so lucky to have you. You might wonder how I am when I'm really depressed. What I probably will say is that you deserve someone better than me. The girl that can handle that is an angle. Thank you for reading my rant. I hope that you will get through whatever you are battling and I wish you the best. Damn I just realized that I haven't told you about my health issues. I already have a post about it I will link it. Thank you.

"you know what's worse then just people that are too happy to understand? Having people who're depressed and act like they can just lecture you, and just tell you to snap out of it.","Fuck my fakeass friends! I fucking hate them! It's the worse when you think you've met likeminded people just to get put the fuck down.

I made a new friend from work and we've been talking about things and what not. He's depressed too, lives on his own barely making a living because he's poor. Had a fucking argument last night them. I think I overreacted. But I got so fucking upset when he said ""The world doesn't revolve around us depressed people"" and goes one about how I need to better. yea like no shit sherlock! of course i know that, god for-fucking-bid i need to vent my emotions. god forbid i can just move out in the next few months and be a motherfucking bum living to paycheck to paycheck like he does.

I just got a new car, and I have student debt I need to pay off. I can't afford to live independently, and yet he goes on to tell me I can save up in the next few months and move out. I tell him it's not realistic, and he acts like I'm not listening to his perspective because I won't make a more radical choice in my life?

Wtf am I supposed to do? Yes I hate living with toxic family, but it's a roof over my head until I actually work towards something better.

But apparently I'm the problem for everyone in my life because of my depression.....why do people have to act this way!? Why do they think it's ok to just dismiss, or even lecture you? i don't want lecturing or fucking positive bullshit! i want empathy and understanding. if i could move,...i would've done so already.

people are fucking bullshit! it's like you try to make connections and then your forgotten, misunderstood, etc. better off being alone than to bother making yourself vulnerable to other people.

sorry for ranting....i only have one friend that cares enough about me. everyone else is just fucking terrible. one last night is too busy being all positively lecturing, the other one damn near forgets my birthday and hasn't bothered to fucking text me in a long while.

Will I never get a break from this bullshit?,"I keep not wanting to post because I feel like everyone's pain is much more valid than mine... Still I am resentful that I don't post because I do wanna express myself.... so I am posting... Lots of venting here... I'm doing really bad.

It's been a hard 8 months for me. It started when my husband and I had communication problems that turned our relationship into a complete misunderstanding. I separated from my husband (I'm also a guy if that matters) who was definitely not right for me and I've regretted it ever since. I feel like I fucked up and I can never go back to being happy... 

So I am generally okay with being alone, but all I do now is compare myself to him and others in relationships and get resentful... It's really hard not to compare... 

Everything is going right in his life. He has a new partner, new place, new friends... And I'm here alone... With no support... I won't have a place to live in a month... And I keep finding out new things about him and his life and compared to him I'm just a piece of shit who can't get over anything and will be stuck in depression and alone for ever... 

He has told me he is over the relationship  with me and his bf is younger, fitter, and more of a positive person than I am. I just found out today that some of my good friends, who haven't been in touch with me for months, have been hanging out with my ex and his bf. I've been asking these friends to hang out for at least a month or two and got subtle signs they weren't interested, like not replying or avoiding the question, but I didn't think anything of it at the time... It's heartbreaking... I've known these people for 10 years.

I feel like depression has made me into nothing more than a negative and bitter person who is obsessed with negativity. I think those friends avoid me because I'm negative so often and it fucking sucks. I try to ask for support sparingly from many of my friends so I don't overwhelm anyone with my negativity. I thought I was doing okay with that but apparently not... But I tried so hard... forced myself to be positive sometimes. I wanted them to have a good time with me. I was a good friend to those ppl, was on time, contributed to conversation, pulled my weight in the friendship, or so I thought...

I'm confused because I want to be able to act like myself and feel sad and not hide it, and accept this and be kind and patient with myself as I try to heal, but part of that means telling my friends how i feel and if these people think I'm negative (and more than one person has said this about me) then I feel like I have to hide myself and I don't have the energy to do that anymore. I'm scared to tell some of my other friends about my problems because I don't wanna overwhelm them... I don't wanna hide who I am...

Maybe I should just be alone... I think that's how I'll end up anyway and it's hard to accept and I'm afraid and angry. I feel like I've failed if I have to be alone... And my ex has won... Even though he treated me terribly during our relationship.

It's just been one thing after the other... breakup, job problems, roomate problems, friends not talking to me, family ignoring me, been too lazy to go outside so my mood gets worse and worse... So I feel like all areas of my life have deteriorated to the point where I can't fix or heal... It's just too much. I need a break from this hell.

My dog isn't doing so well lately.,"I found out a few days ago that we probably have about a month left with my 16 year old dog. I knew it would be coming for awhile now. He's far past the life expectancy for his size, and he's been slowing down a lot over the past year. When we adopted him at 9 years old, we never expected to have this long with him. But a few days back he was at the vet, and we asked for her honest opinion, and she said it might be time to start thinking about a date. I know she's right, the same thought was in my head. I just didn't want her to confirm it. 

He's my first dog, and I can't even begin to think about what I'll do without him. I'm a dog groomer, and the dogs at work help a little. I can pretty much put it out of my head when I'm busy at work. But then I get home and just cry so hard I feel sick. I'm not hungry. I can't clean my house  or do laundry. I don't want to watch TV or do any of my hobbies. I just want to curl up in a ball and cry. I'm going to spend as much time as I can with him in the meantime, but if it hurts this much now I don't know how I'm going to be okay after. 

Usually I have a pretty decent handle on my depression. Now I just feel like it's spiraling out of control and it's never going to be better. I know I should be grateful that's been with us for a lot longer than we hoped, but mostly I'm just devastated about the thought of losing him.",monocle-enterprises,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ocoe6d/my_dog_isnt_doing_so_well_lately/,found day ago probably month left 16 year old dog knew would coming awhile far past life expectancy size slowing lot past year adopted 9 year old never expected long day back wa vet asked honest opinion said might time start thinking date know right thought wa head want confirm first dog even begin think without dog groomer dog work help little pretty much put head busy work get home cry hard feel sick hungry clean house laundry want watch tv hobby want curl ball cry going spend much time meantime hurt much know going okay usually pretty decent handle depression feel like spiraling control never going better know grateful u lot longer hoped mostly devastated thought losing,dog well lately,1380,34
"As truthfully be told here are all the emotions I felt from my eyes in story form, a long reading, skip to the end for a quick summary. (You need to know Spanish and English to read anyway, since I use both languages, feel free to google this)."," 

**ONE: Just breathe (Saturday)**

   Honestly, what gave me the idea to cut myself, it's a question I always asked myself. Maybe it was my emotionally abusive family or my realization that it is scientifically proven that I am attractive. If you're wondering why I said that, it’s because I'm a mouth breather. I breathe through my mouth which means my face is literally flat and my chin has a weird-shaped Adam’s apple simply because I breathe differently. I sleep in the same room as my parents, and as you can guess it isn't exactly the best atmosphere. I wish I had my own room, so I wouldn't have to smell the sweat on hot days. The room has a light in the middle with a little bowl covering it, I was cleaning my bed a long time ago and slapped it with my blanket and broke the bowl and the light. A piece of both of them fell on my bed and every time I turn the light on I’m afraid I'll breathe in carbon monoxide, I probably am.

   I live in a two-bedroom apartment in park hill Colorado, and literally, everything is broken. The linear light bulb in the kitchen flickers and makes a weird buzzing sound. The kitchen floor tiles are torn apart and if I walk in there barefoot I could feel the glue or whatever on the floor. The porch is fine but the electrical box has a broken panel and if anything a rat could climb and turn off the power, which is probably what happens when we lose power every week. The living room is big, I don't know why we call it the living room if the atmosphere is dead, and so is something else under the floor, creating a rotten flesh smell. It isn't a human’s dead body, at least I don't think it is, a few months ago we heard meows of a cat in the basement, we went outside to open the basement and waited 10 hours for the cat to leave when we thought it did we closed the hole to the basement. A few days later we heard it again and left it alone, if it was gonna keep getting trapped in there what’s the point. The door to my room is also broken, my dad broke it down when I locked myself in after an argument. I guess my sister’s room isn't broken, I need to take a breath, I’m aggravated about the place we live but I just need to be grateful instead of being toxic and annoying.

**TWO: Cold (Monday)**

  The cat in my basement must be seeking warmth, it was snowing a lot recently but I shouldn't be surprised since the weather here is bipolar. Poor thing must've been so cold. I asked my mom, ""Do you think it’s still down there?"" She replied, ""Do you smell the rotting corpse?"" To be honest, I didn't expect such a dark reply, she was always kind and honest but after this, my perspective seemed to change, I held her in admiration, I expected her to be my role model, and wouldn't you know it-i'm disappointed. I've become isolated because of her actions, I was unable to make friends and any friends I did make apparently ""sold drugs"" according to her. I wouldn't have space or necessarily any sense of freedom. 

  Maybe she’s just being a mom and trying to protect me but it really isn't helping. I feel as if she doesn't want me to grow up, my father could care less what I did, and I don't know whether or not to be disappointed in him or not. He doesn't seem like he knows what he’s doing, neither of them does in all honesty but I can't blame them. Both are from Mexico so this technology and language in the U.S are very different, my moms’ grandpa was shot to death by police for a domestic violence report made by my Uncle. I can't really get into details since I only ever got a vague briefing on it, but essentially what I can assume is that life didn't treat my mom well either. After this realization a few months ago, I felt like an asshole, cold-hearted and mean for being so heartless.

**THREE: Suffocate (Tuesday)**

 What a bore life is, it’s always gonna be the same thing, you wake up, brush your teeth, go to school or work until you get out, eat, shower then sleep. As a 9th grader, I really shouldn't be focusing on stuff like that, or be paying attention to it but I can't help but notice that there isn't anything interesting. That’s probably why people drink alcohol and do drugs, not to numb pain-or maybe that and to kill time. Me for one, cannot get drunk or high. Anytime I try I fail, it feels as if it’s because I’m conscious, I’m aware that I'm drinking and doing drugs. 

 Have you ever had that moment in which you feel as if you're suffocating? That’s how I feel about life, some would say a drowning sensation but to me, it feels as if I’m overwhelmed by responsibilities I don't even have yet. There is one thing that distracts me though- love. Not that anyone has ever liked me because they haven't. I'm just fascinated by the concept, although some would say it’s just a chemical reaction, how is it possible that you can ""love someone"" when all it is, is a chemical reaction that makes you wanna create babies, but at the same time you can feel physically attracted to someone else. How? That’s a mystery that hasn't been solved yet and unlike my unattractive face I don't care whether or not this has been scientifically proven to be a chemical reaction, there has to be a reason.

**FOUR: Alright (Wednesday, Thursday)**

I'm too focused on that, whatever the hell love is I’ll have a definition for it eventually but right now, in this moment, I'm alright, and the more I tell myself that the more I actually start to believe it. Still doesn't change the fact that I wanna kill myself so badly. Maybe I should actually start reaching out for help instead of a knife. If I actually wanted to kill myself why haven't I done it already? The next morning I went to the school counselor and we spoke about what the possible cause of my depression might be, I really can't be saying it’s depression because I'm undiagnosed but what else am I supposed to call it? Crazy? 

 ""Have you had any past trauma? Emotional? Physical?""

""Well maybe emotional since I really don't know, my mom is overprotective and that really hurts especially if all I wanna do is grow up""

 ""What about physical?""

""No""

 ""Any other trauma I should know about?""

""Well actually maybe both emotional and physical but not because of my family, I had a friend named Mandy she had dyed hair, one side was black and the other side was white, I don't really know what to call her since she wasn't my girlfriend but we started having sex. Eventually, I fell in love with her but never had the chance to tell her since she left without warning, maybe her family forced her to leave after they caught us in her room""

 ""Why wasn't she at your house?""

""My mom doesn't allow me to have sex, she doesn't even know of Mandy, no one in my family does. I could have brought her over but we wouldn't have been able to do anything since my mom had a rule that I had to have my door open if I brought home a girl. And for the second time, I and my parents have the same room""

 ""Okay-now are you making this up?""

""No-wait why would I be-""

 ""Okay, okay I was just making sure, anyway I think it’s time we end our session""

""Oh, so do I just leave?""

  ""Yes""

""Can I at least get a pass?""

Alright, never doing that again.

**FIVE: Trapdoor (Thursday)**

I walk to class contemplating whatever the hell just happened, I reached out for help and the next thing I know I'm being asked whether or not I made it up. As I enter the class, a bully named Daniel attempts to trip me.

 ""What up redneck! Wanna come to my party on Saturday?""

I stare at him but ignore, a trivial point that he made and in all honesty the name calling makes sense but at the same time it doesn't. I have a birthmark on my neck, they said it'd go away in a few weeks but I’ve had it my whole life. Typically someone would associate a redneck as a white racist with a red hat. But for my classmates, its whoever has a hickey or birthmark on their neck. They never take into consideration my Latino heritage, even when I speak Spanish. I can't blame them, their stupid, extremely stupid actually, and I can't just call myself smart without sounding egotistical but that’s what it is.

I have the biggest ego knowing that they think they’re the shit, some of them are in gangs and some pretend to be in gangs. They walk around the school acting all tough, and I can't disagree, their impenetrable bags of meat and are as dumb as I am smart. 

 ""What-you gonna snitch bro?""

""What is your problem, why are you talking to me?""

 ""I'm just asking if you're gonna snitch pussy!""

""No, I’m not, because I could literally care less about what you think, that is if you can, you don't exist in my eyes, and the only time I ever notice you are when you're being an asshole, and that’s the only thing anyone will ever remember you by""

 ""If you don't care, why'd you respond?""

Why did I respond, I haven't really ever stood up for myself before and I didn't care about the party, I've come to the realization that I’ve probably made the situation much worse. Can't help but feel as if my generation, gen-z, is falling through a trapdoor.

**SIX: Crazy (Friday)**

 I'm crazy for thinking like this but in the end, I know it doesn't matter. Any crime I commit, any person I yell at or any great achievement is pointless and I can't stress it enough. It seems to be overlooked and not talked about, that’s why people like me don't have many or any friends. I can't change, it doesn't bother me but it bothers others. I'm better at convincing myself that life sucks without even trying, but can't do the same thing for happiness. I know what you're thinking, ""Why are you crying over a dumb girl dumping you? You realize that there’s people in the cold because they’re homeless and they can't afford food. You have it the best!"" I am aware of these things and I'm sorry if I come off as an asshole, but I really can't simulate the feeling of hopelessness they feel. I'm not them and unfortunately, everyone feels differently about different things so I can't sympathize but I know it sucks ass for them. This is how I feel on a daily basis and it gets worse at night. I don't really have a reason to be depressed, its what I think, and its what the school counselor thought. For what its worth, it might be that I'm crazy, I might be making it up

**SEVEN: Blue (Saturday)**

 Took a loop at the park today, I was bored of being inside the house doing absolutely nothing. Saw the most beautiful person, she had short black hair, an oversized cyan-colored hoodie with navy pants.

 ""What’s up,"" I said as I walked by her

""Hey""

That voice sounds familiar.

   ""Do I know you?""

""Well- you spoke to me first I was just replying""

  ""No, I was just wondering because your voice sounded familiar""

My accent makes me say ""because"" weird, I drag on the ""ca"". 

""I get that a lot- are you flirting with me?""

 ""No- well I thought about it but I genuinely feel like I know you""

""I'm just fucking with you! It’s me, Kimberly""

Kimberly, its been 4 years since she left, she used to be my best friend back in 5th grade, the last memory I have of her is a text on my dads old phone. It was an android emoji with a picture of her family above it, I received it during a quinceanera but never replied.

 ""Holy shit! Why'd you leave the school?""

""I never left, we literally graduated together, I'm still going to school""

 ""Okay makes sense, how’s it been?""

""What school or me in general?""

 ""You""

""I'm fine, I’ve been outta touch with people from our old school, other than the ones who go to Darlin with me, what about you? Have you been in contact with anyone?""

 Searching for any way to answer this question, I don't have friends or attempt to message anyone, so my answer should be no, but I'm here with her.

 ""No, n-no one other than you"" I stuttered

 What the hell is this? Why is she here, does she live near?

 ""Why is the sky blue?"" She asks randomly

**EIGHT: Nevermind (Saturday/Sunday)**

""Uh, I have to go phones vibrating probably my mom calling, bye""

 ""Alright bye!"" She yells from a distance as I run away

 What was that, did she read my mind and hear me ask all those questions?

 ""¿Omar, Dónde estabas?""

""El parque""

 ""Espero que no estés vendiendo drogas""

I'm not gonna argue with her about the same thing over and over again, anytime I wander off to do my own thing she has to assume I’m selling drugs for fucking someone.

 ""Mijo!"" She yells

""Que!""

 ""We're moving on Monday, you get to have your own room but we have to you move schools, I’m sorry you'll have to say goodbye to your friends""

 ""I don't have any anyway, where are we headed?""

""Highlands ranch""

 ""That’s in the mountains, what about grandma?""

""She's fine with it mijo, now go to sleep we have to start packing tomorrow and you'll have to wake up early""

 ""It’s 6 p.m though""

""We wake up at 4 a.m""

  ""Oh""

My alarm scared me, it was set to 3 a.m instead of 4 a.m and I might as well start packing early, I don't really have much anyway. I have 5 shirts, 5 pairs of pants, 5 pairs of socks and one pair of shoes. Anytime I go to Grarnar high school I rotated whatever I wore. My lack of clothes is what granted us the ability to buy a house in the mountains. But then again everything far from Denver is cheaper since is farther from downtown. Everyone wants to live there and I don't blame them, its actually an extremely small city with a lot of traffic but it still opens up a lot of opportunities. I remember staying up at night watching people on the snap map on Snapchat partying downtown. It looked alive, I wish I was down there but right now we are unable to afford anything. 

 ""Mijo come here and help me take my stuff outside"" mom called

""When did you wake up? I woke up at three and i'm still not finished""

 ""Around 2 a.m, I couldn't sleep because of the neighbors""

""Que hicieron ellos?""

 ""We sleep next to their bedroom, take the fattest guess""

Her accent was able to make that seem innocent but at least recently she’s been speaking more English, not that I hate if she speaks Spanish but I myself am not fluent in Spanish, I don't know big words. Ever since I went to school I've been fluent in English more than my first language, it’s terrifying. Kimberly calls and asks why I ran away yesterday, nevermind, guess she doesn't have superpowers.

**NINE: The Viper (Monday/day)**

The day has arrived! I'm so excited I forgot to pack my toothbrush. How were my school grades gonna get transferred over, I’ve been in that school for more than half a year? Doesn't matter, new people and a clean slate. 

 ""Take your shit of the trunk"" father said

""I don't have anything in the trunk""

 ""Then who's clothes would be bright? Tus hermanas no visten colores brillantes""

That's true they don't wear bright colors, my youngest sister wears all black, my second youngest wears brown and white, and my oldest sister wears whatever the hell she can find. This is unusual, i'll just throw it in the trash.

 ""What the fuck!"" my dad exclaimed

""Dijiste que no era la ropa de mi hermana""

 ""Its not, its yours! Lo compré como un regalo tonto""

A bright yellow raincoat, in spring with dandelions, spread all across the grass. Laying on the flowers with my new raincoat, I realize there are more than just dandelions. Roses, Lavander, a white flower that I’ve never seen before. Green grass and an old broken down stone building next to our house. It was brown with a front porch and an oak door with a small shed next to it. It had an upstairs window peering into the driveway. 

 ""Omar!"" I hear across the street

""Kimberly? What are you doing here?! Did you follow me?""

 ""No, I live near here""

""So why were you at Parkhill?""

 ""I was visiting family but got into an argument with my step-dad, you wanna come over""

""Uh, sure let me unpack first""

I'm not gonna question anything instead I'm gonna question everything, I didn't know how to react because it felt like she pulled a ""visiting family"" excuse card. Hopping a fence to get over to Kimberly was probably the worst idea I've had yet, feels like I've got a splinter in my leg now.

 ""What was the argument about?""

""Why does it matter? Mind your business"" Kimberly yells

 ""Shit my bad, I just thought that if you were visiting they'd try and defend you""

""My entire family hates you, not your family, just you-they don't want me talking to you""

 ""So why are you talking to me?!""

""Why am I talking to boys? I'm lesbian, my parents just don't want me hanging around boys because they think I’ll fall in love for something, don't ask me to ask them""

 ""Why'd you say me like I was special, should've just said males, boys, guys. Why is this even a problem?""

""Why the fuck are you asking so many questions?""

 ""The party, held at Daniels house on Saturday""

""Shut up Omar""

 ""What did he do to you?""

""Nothing, can we hurry? It’s about to rain""

We scurry to the back of Kim’s house.

 ""Kimberly!!"" We hear from the inside

""Oh shit my step-dad's inside, uh go to the left side and there's a window I’ll open it for you""

The window wasn't really a window it was a glass door in the shape of a circle that she decided to call a window or maybe it was a window but to me, it’s just a door. She slams the window. Her room is a light purple, maybe Lavander colored, does she like Lavander. She has a nightstand with a mirror, and añl over the nightstand is makeup. The floor is covered in dirty clothes and spiffs are hidden in the pockets of her hoodie. The rain starts to pick up.

 ""Kim! Where the fuck are you? Get me a goddamn beer"" echos through the hall as footsteps get closer

""Get yourself a beer you're already up and walking!""

 ""Should've responded the first time shit head- who the fuck is this?""

  ""Uh, I'm Omar""

""No shit! You're that guy from like four to three years ago that had a crush on Kim- wait why the fuck are you here!""

 ""Dad calm down""

""Don't tell me to calm down wet bitch, you ran off to a party and now you invited this little shit into our house? Who do you think you are? I'm the adult here not you.""

 ""I'm myself asshole, I'm lesbian I'm not planning on doing anything with him""

He laughs

""Just like you said last time""

He hits her

""HEY!"" I yell loudly

He punches me in the stomach

""You walk into my house, with my daughter, and enter her room!""

 ""She is not even your real daughter dumbass""

""She is still family""

 ""Then why did you hit, her""

I kick his balls and run out of the house carrying Kimberly.

""Thank you,"" she says winded

 ""Your step-dads a real asshole, a snake beneath the surface""

""No one says that""

 ""Well I did""

**TEN: Moonlight (Monday/Night)**

The dirt is wet and I'm wearing Vans running away from a crazy lunatic carrying his step-daughter. What a day it’s been, its barely 6 p.m and it's already night. 

 ""Omar""

""What's up""

 ""Why'd you move?""

""I guess I was just able to""

 ""Did you miss me?""

""Uh, is this a rhetorical question?""

 ""You liked me and I left""

""Oh that, it didn't bother me and if anything it helped me get over you quicker, and you don't just ask someone that without it sounding awkward and cringey; can you walk?""

 ""No""

""When can you walk""

 ""Why?""

""Because""

 ""Omar""

""I'm tired""

She gets out of my arms and starts walking.

 ""Why did you carry me in the first place, he slapped my cheek he didn't shoot my leg with a shotgun""

""Oh, that’s true""

 ""You just wanted to carry me didn't you?""

""Shut the fuck up with that no I didn't, and if i did then oops my bad it was internal, I'ma say it now because you're acting suspicious""

 ""Suspicious?""

""I don't like you, Kimberly, not anymore, you're a friend. I carried you because I was full of adrenaline or something. You say your lesbian but keep teasing me. When I saw you on Saturday yeah I thought you were hot until I found out it was you""

 ""Ouch, sensitive much? I'll stop if it means you stop whining""

""Deal""

 ""Where are we?""

We are standing in the middle of a field of tall grass with no buildings in sight and the stars aren't visible only the moonlight. Why does that happen? Somedays at night the stars are entirely visible and the next their not. It’s like they don't wanna be perfect, but they’re supposed to be. 

**ELEVEN: Downstairs (Tuesday)**

We had to sleep under a rock near a creek, I think it was a hiking trail because I could see a bench not too far across the river.

 ""Kim wake up""

""Hm, what, why""

 ""I think I know how to get home""

""You're not taking me back there""

 ""No, I'm not, I wasn't planning to you're gonna stay at my house""

 ""Where would I sleep?""

""My room or downstairs on the couch""

 ""The couch""

""I was gonna tell you to pick that anyway""

 ""How do we get home?

""You see that bench behind the birch moss tree? I think its a hiking trail and we can just follow it either way because they would both be an exit""

 We start the long journey home, on the way my phone finally got service and we started taking pictures. I took a picture of Kim standing on the bench. She took a picture of me standing on two rocks in the creek with my yellow raincoat. We arrive at my house with my parents nowhere to be found and sisters at work or school. I grab Kim some of my sister’s clothes' and grabbed one of my warm blankets since I sleep with three. I handed her my old sleeping bag that I didn't get to use and my dinosaur pillow. 

 ""Can you give me a tour?"" She asks

""Uh, I haven't been in here longer than ten minutes so I'm as clueless as you""

We explore each room, each time getting amazed by the fact that my entire house is the same color as her room, Lavander. I and my family haven't really bought furniture and all we have is a table with metal chairs and a nightstand in each room. The house has 4 rooms and my room is the best because it has a tiled roof with a window. I brought a poster about a video game to make my room feel more full. 

 ""What's in the shed?"" Kim asks

""I have no idea, maybe my dad’s tools he works in construction""

 ""Where are the keys?""

""Probably on the key hanger by the door, a bad idea to have it by the entrance but here we are. Why are you asking questions now""

She grabs the keys and heads outside to the shed, I follow and hear noises coming from it. She turns the key and then turns the knob revealing- geese. There are geese in my shed.

 ""Is this legal""

""Uh, I don't know, don't tell anyone and if you do they were in there before we moved here""

 ""Do they have names""

""Can you actually talk everything you've said so far is a question? No, they don't, because I didn't even know they were here, and now you can't name them""

 ""Why? Why? What? Why?""

""Okay well, I'm going back upstairs""

 ""So am I""

""No, you aren't, you stay downstairs""

 ""The only bathroom is upstairs though""

""Okay fine""

She walks upstairs with me and enters the bathroom. It smells like burning, maybe my mom is home cooking. Never mind, she’s not in the kitchen. It’s coming from upstairs, from the bathroom.

 ""Kimberly, are you fucking smoking in the bathroom?""

""Yeah""

 ""Oh..uh..can I join""

""Let me enter your room""

 ""Fine""

She enters my room with 3 blunts and a lighter.

 ""Why didn't you use your lighter to create fire back in the rain?""

""My lighters always break when I use them in the rain""

Looking at the clock I realize a lot of time has gone by, I look out the window to reassure myself, and sure enough, the sun is rising. 

 ""Holy shit! It’s three a.m you gotta go downstairs and sleep""

""Wait why?""

 ""We haven't slept much at all these last two days and I don't want you to die, please go downstairs""

""Alright, fine""

**TWELVE: Your escape (Wednesday)**

The next morning I heard my parents laughing downstairs, I haven't told them about Kimberly so I hope they don't freak out 

 ""Omar, no nos hablaste de tu novia"" exclaims my mother

 ""Girlfriend?"" I and Kim say at the same time

""Mom No es así, su padrastro era un imbécil y no creo que ella estuviera segura allí""

 ""You're even protecting her,"" my older sister says as she enters the house.

""Goddammit, I'm going outside""

 ""No you're going to school,"" my dad says shaking his keys

""School? What school?""

 ""Darlin Highschool""

""That’s my school too"" Kim blurted

 ""I'll take you both"" dad insisted

""Why are all of you calm about Kim being here?"" I laughed

""She gonna live here until-""

 ""Live? You don't get to decide that Omar"" Kim shouted

""Okay, you're right, she'll STAY here until she feels comfortable leaving""

 ""Guess I'm leaving right now""

""Wait Kimberly- that’s not what I meant""

She exits the house and starting hopping the fence.

 ""You better chase her, if her step-dad really is an asshole you have to protect her"" my youngest sister declared

I sprint out the door and jump over the fence

""KIMBERLY"" I shouted

 ""WHAT?"" She snapped

 ""Why do you have to care about me? You say you don't like me yet treat me nicely what is your problem.""

""Kim, I'm sorry""

 ""Kiss me""

""What? I thought you were lesbian""

 ""Guess I'm bisexual now, kiss me""

I kiss her on the cheek.

 ""Kimberly, come back, I want you to be safe""

She wraps her arms around me and drags me to the ground.

""Kimberly-""

She starts making out with me near her house, I can't help but admit that I liked it. 

""Do you, wanna go to my room?"" I asked

""Yeah"" she agreed

We go back to the fence and hop it, run towards my house and burst through the door, head upstairs, and enter my room. She kisses my lips as I caress her thighs. I slide my hands up and down her body taking off her panties and bra. 

 ""Omar, I love you,"" she says with excitement

""Why?"" I asked confused

 ""You're my escape from reality""

""I'm your escape?"" 

**THIRTEEN: People (Still Wednesday)**

""Yeah""

My father bursts down the door

 ""I knew she was your girlfriend!"" He yells as he closes the door as quickly as he opened it.

""Goddammit we still have to go to school"" I exclaim

We get dressed and go downstairs.

 ""Y'all ready?"" Dad laughs

""Get the fuck in the car"" I shout

Why would my father open the door knowing he heard us? I'm starting to hate him bit by bit. But the truth is I hate people in general. No one likes a straightforward answer, it always has to be complicated for it to make sense. People exchange numbers and socials to later never text or call, but just to observe. Everything is centered around dating and I don't want my story to be about romance. I'm going to break up with Kim, I know I just got with her but I have to.

During our lunch period, my plan is to be direct with her. No extra time, It’s now or never or I’ll never escape.

The bell rings and it’s time for lunch, walking over to Kim I notice water on the window, is it raining again?  I walk over to her table

“Hey Kim, I have to tell you something”

“What’s up?”

“I think we should break up - now I don’t think our relationship is bad in any way, and I know we just got together but I think it’s best for both of us to separate”

This was a good idea, we moved too fast, faster than light if anything. Why’d I take up this responsibility? I sat there not wanting any then took the hardest quest on the board. She’s not my problem, and she shouldn’t be. She’s an entirely different species I almost have no experience with. 

*Last chapter incoming****: Sunday is when Stratus clouds form potholes, and in one minute they can cocoon you. All your phantoms will return, memories, the good ones at least, and fireworks will explode in the sky as flames fall down they will light the pines and burn the bad ones.*** 

**FOURTEEN: On the Fourth of July (Sunday)**

I can summarize life in a pretty short way. We live we die. We build memories, from parents forcing their ideals onto us and hoping that we’ll become what they want us to. Then there are those born without any, which I cannot speak for. But we choose our own path and become stronger in spite of bad memories. I like music, I could totally become an artist but I’m not really good at anything. If I see an opportunity I should take it, be it a good friend or a girl that likes me. But at the same time, I have every right to assume there’s a catch. Life is too short to risk anything and this will fly under people’s radar but it’s true. I or you could die any moment, we don’t know. That’s what depresses me I guess. I wanna live, I wanna die, but I’m already gonna die? So why not live? It’s a paradox and maybe in the end I was never depressed. I don’t know what it’s like to struggle, I have a bed, shelter, family, I couldn’t ask for more. I myself don’t know anymore and I seek validation. You people tell me that I just have too much self-awareness, and yeah, maybe that is the issue. The biggest issue of all is that self-reflection that makes you overthink when self-aware.

I dont know if I made the right choice or not, but it really wouldn’t matter because it results wouldnt even change if I did or didn’t give up. I’m alone, fat, ugly, ungrateful, I shouldn’t exist and I should’ve never been born. An In-patient facility didn’t help, I was offered therapy but didn’t take that either because it was online, and either way I don’t think it would have been able to help me. I’ve seen so many things I want to remember, I find beauty in nature and vibes and cultures, I love art and music. Nice people, mean people, old people. Stars in the sky, planets I want to visit. But I’m lost and confused, I’m afraid of growing up and I keep and falling into these spirals, each one getting deeper and taking me for a loop. Really wanting to teach me that history repeats itself. I do the same things, make the same mistakes, it’s a cycle.- I wanna go to Japan, see a light festival, go to India and eat food, I wanna explore every building go to every party. Things. Dammit. I wanna do THINGS! I wanna LIVE I wanna be alive! I dont really have a destination and I’ll down all the pills I have to feel better, I’ll fill my contacts with suicide hotlines. I’ll count the time on the clock, I’ll work out, I’ll eat healthily, I won’t be mean or do anything bad to my health. I won’t ever cut myself again. I’ll form as many memories as I can, I’ll take as many pictures as my phone can hold. I’ll find a treasure, find true love, I’ll even have a family. I’ll be the best father even though most fathers are usually bad. I wanna drink every drink, explore every sewer, I wanna time travel, and watch all marvel movies and shows before the world ends. I’ll stand still for 12 months, I’ll watch snow fall and rain. I’ll watch plants grow. I’ll make music, starting with an acoustic song, might name it slushie based on a memory I had with a cute girl under a bridge at night, her lips were green because of her slushie.  Now, I am not gonna offer advice, and I can't make any promises I can't keep since I cannot help. I am here because i wanna know what you guys think? Its an obvious answer. Am I depressed?

interests and socialization outside my room really don't work for me,"Hi all,

I'm not entirely sure whether the sheer lack of interests and hobbies I've been into is because of the  raging pandemic and the need to shield others, if not myself from this thing- or if it's because I'm genuinely disinterested in doing anything else other than constantly being on my computer and looking for a job.

I'm 23F, I'd got a referral to psych services when I was 15ish because I'm biologically predisposed to have depression ( due to my congenital hypothyroidism)- but I was too scared of crying in front of anyone because I'm an ugly crier (and ugly in general), so I bailed. I haven't been to any mental health- related specialist, support group, or whatever. I constantly feel like I'm a shame of this family, society, planet. I can't be arsed to have a hobby, interest, anything active to do. I'm unable to focus on a book, but I can watch anything for hours, or avoid people that 'care' for me only for their own benefit (they contact me only when they need a favour). I feel tired after running an errand- which usually takes less than an hour. I actively avoid areas of my neighbourhood that are visited by people I know but don't want to meet and talk to. I feel like everyone around me just hates me, so I avoid talking to others and being a bother. 

Seeking out help is genuinely something I never even expected I'd do, but I keep thinking all this, I keep being tearful and shaky, exhausted after a very short conversation with a stranger in the grocery store. Denial doesn't work, I guess. 

How do I get out of this state? Absolutely no idea what to do.

I don't seem to find anything that interests me and even if I do, I think it would be impossible because of my Autism and the way my brain works. I keep this my secret from everyone because I am paranoid that they would belittle me or feel sorry for me. It wouldn't make things any better.

I’m getting depressed again,I’ve been doing fine for a while but this past week and a half has been so fucking brutal to me. I have no motivation to do anything and I’m just sad. It could be the fact that I don’t really have any friends at the age of 15 or something else. I haven’t had no one to talk to because everyone that used to help me doesn’t talk to me anymore. Another thing that might be bothering me is how much I get shamed by my online friends for being a virgin. We’ve known each other for a long time and we always go at each other but it’s starting to get to me. Ik that’s something I shouldn’t really care about but it’s hard not to when everyone around isn’t. And the fact that people are posting pictures of them and their friends is hurting me too because I’m not doing that. I’m just some fucking nobody that no one would care about if they just disappeared. I’m awkward and weird and everybody in my high school probably doesn’t even want to try to talk to me because of how quiet I am. I just don’t want to feel alone anymore.

My mom isn’t the sharpest lightbulb and sometimes when i open up about the very damaging things i do to myself she doesn’t understand how its not healthy that i starve myself im starting to enjoy just eating a saltine or two and mixing it with water in my mouth to make a paste so it sits and makes me feel more full or how I sleep to avoid hunger pangs and at this point i don’t get them or if i do they don’t hurt anymore. I don’t know who to talk to cause im very anti-social in person i avoid everyone i don’t have friends and i don’t try to make them i just avoid people and im okay with that but i wish sometimes i could let out what im doing without someone saying wow thats great its a cry for help but my mom honestly doesn’t know a thing i have to raise her and teach her how to do so much and its starting to take a toll on my mental i feel like im in my late 20’s most people my age just go out of high school i never graduated i have been working for the last 3 years and i have the mentality of an adult i don’t have any friends i have a sister but she is just obsessed with money and her life i don’t really have anyone im close to not even my dad all he does is work after my brother died i noticed how alone i am i just want someone to know im not really okay but that im so used to living like this it no longer bothers me it just is very empty and that i don’t know who i am anymore i spend so much time in my room that i forget im alive i just blank out its an issue but i don’t know how to tell anyone cause i when i open up my parents avoid saying anything cause they don’t know what to say so they just say good job to me starving myself, depriving myself of sleep or water, I just say im mediating so i don’t have to explain to my mom that its not a good thing that im starving myself cause she is honestly just that dumb. i hate having to be the parent to my own parents i wonder if anyone else deals w this.",Religon0fthesuN,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oceytt/explaining_depression_to_a_parent_who_doesnt/,tldr rant honestly know long pushing sometimes starve workout try make emptiness go away take adderal get hungry thing live mom im 18 open tell much starving pushing think good thing say wow thats awesome like im saying achievement mom sharpest lightbulb sometimes open damaging thing understand healthy starve im starting enjoy eating saltine two mixing water mouth make paste sits make feel full sleep avoid hunger pang point get hurt anymore know talk cause im anti social person avoid everyone friend try make avoid people im okay wish sometimes could let im without someone saying wow thats great cry help mom honestly know thing raise teach much starting take toll mental feel like im late 20 people age go high school never graduated working last 3 year mentality adult friend sister obsessed money life really anyone im close even dad doe work brother died noticed alone want someone know im really okay im used living like longer bother empty know anymore spend much time room forget im alive blank issue know tell anyone cause open parent avoid saying anything cause know say say good job starving depriving sleep water say im mediating explain mom good thing im starving cause honestly dumb hate parent parent wonder anyone else deal w,explaining depression parent understand,2350,56
I don't have a reason to keep going anymore,"I'm 22 years old, I have been fighting with myself for the past 8 years of my life. I did not have depression until recently, hell I don't even know if I have it right now but I am pretty sure I have never felt this bad in my whole life. 

I've been obsessed with becoming successful and have been working and studying hard these past 8 years of my life. It started with a dream but quickly became an obsession, I started to make friends with similar goals. My family is incredibly successful, everyone around me is and they keep on telling me I will be one day as well or that I should work harder. I've been getting so much pressure, the only reason I kept on living was to become successful I never doubted myself ever. Until a few weeks ago, I started questioning myself and since I did I've been feeling empty inside.

I only get joy when I am making money because in my mind that is what's moving me up in the social hierarchy. But the moment I fail that emptiness comes back. I've even given up on my girl in order to invest more time into studying and working. 

But all of this just feels useless, money is useless I've been working and studying so hard for nothing. I keep on having these conversations with myself, telling me for example ""you're pathetic you won't ever reach greatness. Alexander at your age had conquered the world.""

Is this normal?,"First time posting to this sub. Apologies if I do something wrong in this. 

I'm wondering whether or not thoughts of suicide become more clear and thoroughly planned out as I become more functional. I have been doing much better in my day today such as taking a shower most days, eating, and participating in normal day today. The thoughts of suicide are much more vivid and clear. I developed many more plans since I've been getting better. And rather than fixing on the type of death, I branched out to other ways of killing myself.

I really just don't understand because I feel that I'm still in the same place but the ups are more up and the downs are more down. I still would rather not be here than deal with the ups and downs. It also seems that as I become more functional, my sadness and helplessness has turned to rage and anger. I envision myself just randomly hurting myself because I want to. Most likely because I somehow deserve it. And it would feel like a relief. 

Anyway... I just was wondering if anyone else experiences that. And also that is going to be okay because it feels like it's not today.

Help.,"Today is my 6th year anniversary of sobriety. I timed it so that the new car-which I’ve worked every day for and with a huge chunk of my savings gone-I get my first brand new car today. Mine. And NEW. 
I don’t mean that in a selfish way, I just mean it’s kind of a big deal to me personally. I don’t know very many people in general aside from work- which why would they care? which is why I’m posting here. 
All the paper work is done / insurance blah blah- all I have to do is take the plates off of this Corolla, wait for my sister to be ready to drive up and pick up the new one! When I was taking off the plates to my car I was actually overcome with emotion and for a second I thought it was excitement and pride. But since that moment a couple hours ago, all I’ve felt is down and anxious on myself. A little off topic but-
I do suffer from some pretty severe anxiety and depression (honestly, we all do.-my body just handles it in a shitty way.) 
Ok ok getting back on track. 
My second thought was that I might just be down for a while because I’m kind of saying goodbye to this car- which I do love and have had FOREVER. That must be it and waiting still for this to pass. I don’t even want to go anymore. I truthfully don’t deserve the car. I was *such* a fuck up for *such* a long time. I’ve done a lot of really selfish shit when I wasn’t sober. And to think that’s only what I remember. I was just Always so selfish. It was such a dark time. And I recently started mental counseling and they really go deep into your past and the stuff that is coming up it’s like damn, what a horrible person I’m talking about. Yup oh wait that’s me. Even now, feeling bad for myself. Always selfish. I just want to cancel it and give money to my immediate family who had to deal with drug addict me for all that time. My car still runs. I mean there’s no radio or interior light It’s got 259,000 miles on it but it is a Corolla and anyone who has had one will tell you that’s really not that bad. And they’d be right. I don’t think I deserve this car. I don’t know what to do but the more I type this all out the more I’m figuring out I don’t think I deserve it.  I just don’t have anyone to tell so thank you .

This year has done irreparable damage on my psyche. Irreparable.,"I spent 5 fucking years climbing out of the deep pit of suicidal depression I had fallen in. I was a little unstable, but walking on the right path. 

2020/2021, my path was picked up and hurled into space. 

The future is bleak for all, not just for me. I look around at my friends and at the world in front of us.

There are no jobs. None that pay well enough to live independently, anyway. Jobs requiring degrees and 2+ years experience are paying pennies above minimum wage. This is the most bullshit I've ever seen. And these jobs feel fucking meaningless. Shuffling papers. Sit around for 8 hours and do 2 hours of work. 

If you want to get out of the rat race and find a meaningful job, then have fun starving to death. Society doesn't value meaningful jobs. Take care of animals, sick people, study nature, be a park ranger. Be prepared for minimum wage and 60+ weekly hours. 

I don't feel that I will ever have stability or comfort. I do not have the energy to work 40 hours a week, let alone more than that. **I don't feel valued by society - if even ""essential"" workers don't deserve to be paid well enough to have a home, what hope do I have?**

Normally little things get me through the day. But after everything I've witnessed this year - the conspiracies, the refusal to work together, the corruption, the brutality, the wars - I don't feel as though I have anything to look forward to. I'm about to turn 30 and still do not have an established career, life, home, or anything, and my body is already starting to fail me with constant illness. I can't see my friends anymore, or go anywhere or do anything. 

I'm drowning in despair and hopelessness which gets worse with every day. I feel powerless to stop anything or improve my life in any way. I truly believe that working harder will not get anywhere. I feel as though if I remain living, I am only going to witness more suffering. The extinction of more animals, a greater divide of the classes. More poverty, more tribalism. 

**I do not believe I will ever be comfortable. I do not believe we will ever see justice against the super rich. I do not believe the Earth will be ok. I have no hope. I want out. I want to die.

How do I start valuing my life again?,"I've been struggling for years of depression but it has gotten worse nowadays that not even in a week I'm already breaking down. It's the feeling of life would be much better when I'm not here anymore. I keep seeing people disgusted of me for what I like and use for comforts that I can't even enjoy the things I like anymore. I started to hate it and I lost all meaning of life that I don't even mind if I actually go to hell if I die.

My life in my home isn't good either with all the traumas and physical abuse when I was a kid. My parents didn't do that now but it feels like I'm still walking on glass every time I did something bad. I keep getting ridiculed by my mom specifically when I'm too depressed to get up and eat anything by saying I'm lazy and never appreciate her hard work to buy food for me but never go downstairs to eat.

idk,"I'm not quite sure if this is the best place to put this but I just needed to rant and cry my eyes out because, well it's family shit ofcourse. I don't think I have it bad as most people do but I'm this 🤏 close to doing something bad to myself and I know atleast one person cares about me and I don't want to let them down. So this is about my dad, I'm from a asian (indian) household and if you must know they aren't always the best. I'm (17) and you know doing the typical engineering coaching so i get into a decent college because jee is so hard and i cant understand shit since its online and these classes are so long and demanding, I finally have vacations starting from today and i woke up pretty late (around 9) and I FELT SO GOOD BECAUSE I FINALLY GOT 8 HOURS OF SLEEP. (generally i sleep at 2 and wake up at 7 for school) and I started studying from 10 till around 1:45, had lunch attended class from 2 till 9 and then i had to do my basic exercising and bathing and then finally sitting down for homework and self study and clearly im quite busy, and then i had my dad come scolding me for like 45 mins straight for not doing chores, (i dont do them on friday) and the thing is, he's always like this, he doesn't care how busy you are or whay important stuff your doing, if he asks you to do something he expects you to drop everything and come do it right away. In the scenario you don't, you'll either get hit or scolded until u can't even breathe. And it's the last year of school so i have to yknow do extra circulars, courses and voulenterring etcetc and build up your applications and whenever I try to go talk to him about it he just dismisses me and tells me to go away and stop bothering him and thats fine i guess, I can figure it out msyelf as well and when i finally ask him to go out and do something he never allows. He's barely let me go out in 2 years. He keeos saying its because of corona but he himself goes to office everyday? I'm literally suffocated at home. I try to talk to him to let me out but he just locked me up in my room the whole day, and my mom cant help me either, we're all too afraid of him. I ask him for help to figure out what i want to do after school, how to build up a resume, how to look for internships but he just tells me to shut up and go away.  He cares alot about his work and his coworkers, if any of them need money he'll be the first to give but when it comes to my education, im wasting his time and money apprently. oh did i mention the fact that he wished i was a guy? yeah thats there too. he just wants me to stay at home and be a maid and manage only my studies and somehow get into a top college, its not that hes concerned about my studies either nono he wants me to *not* study and be a topper and get into a really good college so he can brag about it. He says I've dissaipointed him because i have to spend so much time studying and still don't manage to get full marks in everything (i end up losing 1-3 marks due to nervousness and i take alot of time to study since stuff doesn't go easily into my head) and moreover im a fat child so he's embarrassed to take me out as well. Maybe that's why he doesn't let me go out haha relevation. I asked him about gym so many times but he just says im too fat to go there so that's that. I was looking forward to escaping once i start college but he wants me to go to a online one. He's just a very manipulative, abusive and such a controlling bastard, I'm barely hanging on.

My mom won't be there for the important moments (because I have to cut her off),"I love my mother dearly but she and I have a very toxic relationship. She has said multiple times that she doesn't know how to be a mother to me, regardless of the fact that I have told her what I need from her.

It's getting to a point where I am realizing that the only way I can stop expecting her to be my mother is to stop thinking of her as my mother. 

But this means that in all those moments a girl needs her mom, I'll be alone. 

I'll be alone on my wedding day. 
I'll be alone when we have our first big fight.

what the fuck,"Hi you guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I just really need to vent a bit or otherwise I'm going to blow up. Life just really fucking sucks. You can never get out of your self and I'm the one making my life unliveable.

 I ghost everyone because for some reason I'm terrified of responding to messages, I'm dropping out of uni after failing a year already and I really can't stand my shit it anymore. I know I overthink and there's was to diminish anxiety over time but I'm too exhausted to continue. 

It's either be alone and wallow in fear, distress and self hate or be with others and put on a mask, get too scared to speak to others and see how far behind I am. I'm acutely aware of how self-centred this is, truly, but what the fuck! I've spent my life building the illusion that it gets better but if really doesn't (or at least I can't see the silver lining from where I'm standing).

 The only cope I've found is browsing and I'm falling into echo chambers. There's so much suffering and I can't do shit about any of it because all I have energy to do is to try and get through the day. I fucking quit everything I do, tried going to AA meetings but panicked after they started to get to know me and quit. I'm just dead weight at this point, causing stress for everyone around me.

I'm so TIRED of not trusting myself and disappointing everyone, being jealous of others and just not having anything together. I can't get close to anyone, I don't have enough self esteem...

Anyways, I just want to scream into the void for bitter release, but that's never going to come is it?

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you all are getting by out there, a day at a time if needed, but what the heeellllllll the only thing keeping me sane r now is Monty Python. Thank god for the french waiter video

Dad keeps handing me his thesis from his time as a student, which isn't helping at all since the end goal of our researches are very different. My classmates seems to fare even better than me. I regret agreeing with my parents to further my studies to degree. The entire semester appeared that I'm pretty much an underachiever compared to my classmates. The only enjoyments I can get is only out of education and that's it. Everything in my class seems like a ticking time bomb just to brand me as a complete loser. Ironically my lecturers and classmates ***aren't*** actually jerks.

End of the road,"Much things happened through the years. From the exterior, I m a 24 years old girl from a good family, with no money issues. But with a closer look, when I was a kid my parents dismissed some difficulties I had at school concerning kids being mean, saying it was me who searched problems. My dad was forcing me to have my hair cut very short, causing kids to be mean towards me. He told me stuff like, when my hair was cut, ""you re my daughter again"". When I recall, I was afraid of him when I was a kid. When I was a teen, he made critisms about my clothes (they were casual. Only monochrom shirts), my hair, and said I had a big ass and big thighs (I were maybe 58 kg for 1m69). In addition, I didn t have a door to my room, what was very stressful at times. I told him multiple times I wanted a door, telling him I wanted to change my clothes in privacy. He laughed and told me there was nothing to watch anyways. Right now I m really anxious having intimacy with men. Once a man tried to hug me, but I instinctively went against it and couldn t. That s because I m afraid someone would hurt me. In my teen years I began to feel a lot of anxiety, and made a depressive episode. Then I began medicine school, and had cyclic periods of bad anxiety and depression. I communicated various times to my family I was feeling awful, but they can t hear it. It s hard to explain. They just deny it, they don t want to see it. For at least 7 years I tried therapies, but it wasn t always good experiences. It was either hurtful, either wasn t helping me. Now I m really feeling the lowest ever. It s extremely painful. I just told my mother about suicide, and I insisted on it, asking what she was feeling about it, and she said it was because of the pills I m taking. It hurts so much.

Snap back to panic attacks,"Yesterday I had my first panic attack after a year and since, suicidal thoughts have started to roll back in. The thought of relapsing back into that hellish depressive state I was in for 4 years before I started taking medication is so fuckin scary. 
 I've always wanted to be an author and I've already written one book, but can't continue no more due to depression.
Yesterday I went to a bookstore with my girlfriend and the thought of me not ever being able to publish my shit struck me like a truck. Looking at all of those books, at all of the creative minds behind them, I got jealous, then mad, and then finally accepted my defeat. I realized that nah I'm never gonna see my book on the book shelves because I'm too tired to go on, because I can't even write one more sentence for the life of me.
 ""I'm just a could've been should've been never was never ever will be"" played in my head as I gradually found it harder to breathe. And there it was,  the thing I thought I had finally gotten rid of, clutching its way back into my life once again, telling me I'm alive bitch. My breaths became quicker and quicker, louder and louder. Gasping for air. I wanted to drop to the floor of the crowded bookstore and start crying, wailing, screaming like I should've, but by some miracle I held it back, which in return caused me to get a killing headache. My girlfriend came to my rescue, snapped me back to reality. My knees were weak I wanted to faint.

My experience regarding depression,"Hi all,

I am new to reddit, however I am not new to depression.

I have literally been diagnosed with a few pink F-1/2x diagnoses (psychotropic behavior) and was taking every single possible pill for a few years (anti depressants, mood killers, etc)

Let me start by saying this:

IT IS NOT BAD TO SEEK HELP IF YOU ARE SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION! No, I am not talking about ""opening"" up to friends/family that most likely will make you a clown and either call you an attention seeking person or just pat you by the back and tell you that it's just a ""period"" and it will pass.

  
IT WILL NOT PASS!!! IT WILL NOT PASS UNLESS YOU TREAT IT!

Don't care what the society will think if you visit a therapist or take pills that will help you heal/pass that stadium in life. It's dark, trust me I know it is dark, I've been literally living in my own shit for months not CARING how I look, what I wear, what I eat or how I smell. 

That's what depression slowly does to you - it kills the purpose to live that every human being should have.

Stay safe friends and always do what is best for you, no matter what the public will think.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: If you suffer from a depression, visit/talk to a professional, not a friend or someone from your family as they will either underestimate the condition you are in or just give shit advises that won't help.

"I self harmed for the first time, I would appreciate if someone could explain what's going on with me, these aren't the type of feelings I could ever talk about","I'm not sure if this sub is the right place or if deppressed is the right word but I thought I'd give it a shot. Apologies if this is unstructured and confusing. I've been writing this post for 4 months but I got so triggered last night and cut myself, I'm desperate for advice, so I thought I'd just merge all of the information together. I've tried to be vague and leave out details about the source because I'm so ashamed of it. As well as a direction and advice, I'm interested to know what people can make of this and if I deserve to complain about my feelings. I feel lonely and I'll never get to talk about the source of these feelings in any more detail than this post on an anonymous account.

It's not the type of fear anyone can empathize with or understand. If I had a fear this bad but of someone being killed, taken advantage of, those are understandably disturbing thoughts, even the idea of not happening to me but someone else, you would be able to sympathise with me. But comparing my fears to something reasonable like fear of someone dying is giving me too much credit. If I was to speak about the specifics, you'll unconsciously think ""I'm glad I'm not like that"" which is why I have to keep this so vague. I can't take these feelings seriously so imagine how impossible it is for someone without all this context. These feelings of grief or heartbreak (if they're the right words) started with a fictional character I didn't like who I would uncontrollably think about, and that isn't even the unusual part. At first glance, my feelings are stupid and unreasonable which is true, but it's a lot more complicated than that, with layers and some contradictions. I was perfectly fine, then gradually over two and a half years, my negative feelings have gone from a fictional character, to a type of fictional character, to a few real people, to pretty much anyone and now I fking hate the world I'm in and the people I'm stuck with. I hate the way people are the way they talk. I can't respect what people do to satisfy themselves and each other. My stomach and heart aches, It's difficult to think about anything else, my mind is on a group of random people. Trying not to distract myself from anything because it takes a lot of concentration to do this much mental gymnastics and denying. My only temporary escape is to write in this post, and even now I find myself stopping just to rethink over and over and reanalyse everything they said, what was hopefully exaggerated, what was figurative, what was literal, just from a YouTube comment of someone giving their life story, that I found 3 months ago for example. When I've posted before, I get asked if had a concussion, spiritual awakening, repressed memories, but I honestly have no explanation. I used to be terrified of a very different trope when I was very young up to my teenage years. I guess that's similar but it only scared me, it doesn't hurt me like this. Other than that, I've had a healthy childhood, not lost anyone close to me, never been abused, maybe a little emotional abuse, my parents are very sensitive too. I currently have no friends, crippling social anxiety, and I'm lonely but that seems like another less important issue that won't solve anything

Let's call this fictional character ""1"". I may have gone into unnecessary detail explaining this fake person so here's a TL;DR: A character in a show made me slightly uncomfortable, it gradually built up and I was thinking about 1 all the time, I became a fan of the show as a defence mechanism that keeps backfiring. The same thing happened to another character in the same show and they both equally discomforted me so I never looked at the show again. The next year, the fear became less bearable and I developed negative feelings for 8 other fictional and not fictional people.

If person reading this can figure out the show I'm describing, I'd prefer you to tell me without naming any names. In November 2018 I watched a TV show because I was bored. There was a scene focused on a character and the dialogue didn't sit right with me and I felt a very brief feeling of discomfort before I immediately forgot about it. This was the type of forgettable character that I found too bland to even form an opinion of at the time. I knew that I'd forget about this character's existence as soon as I stopped watching the show which was true for about 4 months, then I got very subconscious flashbacks, that were too subtle to acknowledge, I just felt a few little discomforting vague memories randomly. Around March, I decided to watch the rest of the first season, pretending no weird feelings were happening. As 1 showed up, I was trying to remove these feelings. It was a sympathetic situation so I told myself to feel sympathy which made me do fine for the rest of the season. Up to this point, everything I was thinking was pretty much subconscious. Now that I finished I went back and watched the scene with the dialogue I didn't like, now that I thought I was over it and nothing changed, I just felt bad again. Although I knew I was having weird feelings, I hadn't acknowledged yet that this was actually a thing. This entirely new emotion made no sense to me. I felt overwhelmed and sad but not at all like crying. Just to add to the confusion of that feeling, it was about a made up person who I didn't even know the name of. Further adding to the confusion I never heard of anyone being this sad over such a specific thing in fiction or real life. Most people get upset about death or breakups. I can't say when this exactly began within November to March but this was the moment I consider the start. I started to think about these feelings with words and I told myself something along the lines of ""this needs to go away, I'm feeling bad because of a fictional character"". I know now that I shouldn't patiently waited for time to pass and none of this would have happened but I didn't know that and my only solution was to find whatever I needed in the rest of the show which mostly backfired but occasionally helped. These bad feelings drew me into the show and into becoming a fan for a number of reasons. I was a fan because it was proof that I wasn't feeling bad, so in denial in a way. Within the five months I was a fan, I bought the video game adaptation and the sequel books even though I don't read. Maybe this is irrelevant but I like physical instead of digital, and I needed these products to be physical I guess because it's physical proof on the shelf that I'm ok with this show and character and I felt a bit proud of myself when they were delivered. The time it took for it to ship to my house was the most I'd ever been excited for a video game because I thought it was going to fix the problem and it had every reason to. custom characters and building relationships with the characters of the show, which was perfect because I could essentially interact with this person semi-canonically as an accurate depiction of myself so I could pretty much talk to this person I was having trouble with literally. The game doesn't take itself as seriously as the show which I found comforting at the time. I believe the opposite happened where instead of taking it less seriously because of the goofiness, it proved to me that I'll take anything seriously no matter how goofy something is. I even considered getting one of those funko figures even though I don't collect those and I'm not really a fan of collecting overpriced merch. But I think this is significant that I even considered having this character in my house when now I'm genuinely offended that a cute collectable of this character even exists. I thought about this character a lot deliberately too. If I was ever uncontrollably feeling bad about the character and specific events, I'd twist it into a direction I was more comfortable with involving the character as a cope. Mostly I'd just talk and ask questions in person which is really sad but it helped and I came up with about 10 drawn out scenarios. After a few weeks, I realised that the game didn't work, as well as I thought, so I decided to watch the next few seasons. I don't like pirating but I justified it because I needed every bit of redeemable content I could find and the little information I had was promising. I remember thinking to myself, it would be good if the same thing happened with another character in the same show to take my mind off 1 which coincidentally happened and didn't make me feel any better. The ""2"" feelings gradually developed over the last few episodes and my time reflecting on them. Instead of taking my mind off 1, I'd switch between 1 and 2 every couple of days. I'd have these big spikes going from feeling extremely bad to extreme relief the next day. I thought the shift from horrible to happy was a coincidence but now that I think about it, I was actually just trying to recover from that feeling by telling myself I was over it because of one little good detail. Whenever I felt so bad about this character, I'd keep watching the show, watch videos, read character wikis, find interviews from the creator to find something redeemable and sometimes it worked which gave me massive relief for a bit. All it took was a different perspective which shifted the trope into something I can understand and tolerate, and again I was over it. I pretended that I was misinterpreting the character this whole time which was partly true. This already made me happy but it was still on the back of my mind until there was one moment in the show that made me the happiest I've felt watching anything. I already convinced myself I was over it, the sequel books coincidentally acknowledged my feelings, the creator said in an interview that the exact thing I wanted could happen, and then the show went the extra mile with this beautiful scene. This shot of 1 blew me away and abolished what was left of the horrible feelings entirely. I was so happy that I didn't care if the creator followed through. That got my 1 feelings out of the woods and about 3 months later I kept reading the books and a similar moment happened with 2. For some reason after that, they both started creeping back in gradually over the next week and I stopped my addiction with this show and planned to return to it in exactly I year when I should be over it. I had two chapters left but I thought I'd leave the show entirely, not look at anything related to this show for now until something good happened. Over 2020, 1 and 2 would creep up in my head now and again and remind me of their existence but around 11 months, I was convinced I was over 1 but looking back on it, I was making room for 4 new characters to uncontrollably think about with this thing or trope. I theorized that if I had a strong feeling of nostalgia from my time away from this show, that would do it for me. The soundtrack was very good and manipulative and probably the only reason I watched past episode 1. The idea of being a fan again wasn't looking good but I decided in exactly a year after I'll binge the soundtrack. It was overwhelming and I was unsure listening to it, it was still a great soundtrack but I wasn't getting the expected closure. I got a bad feeling and thought I hope I didn't restart 1 again and as usual, that started it again and I was disappointed in myself. Around October 2020 I just lay there and suddenly decided to evaluate this character as a whole and it hit harder then than it ever had, how completely unfair it is and stupid this character is. It was a while since I thought about this character and since I'd gotten worse, it really hurt now that I had all the information. It was like I was back at square 1 but as a different worse person who spent too long worrying about this fake person. I finally figured out exactly what it was that bothered me so much, and the realisation didn't help the way I thought an explanation would, it just made me stuck with no excuses. No shifting of perspectives, optimistic ending or 1 second good moment would ever get me out of this and I realized I'll never get closure. Since then, this character keeps showing up in my recommended in different instances. I think my situation is comparable to breakups. People stalk their ex's Instagram for the same reason I was watching the whole show, reading whole character wikis, character analysis videos, buying stuff from the show, finding every bit of content about this person. I've recently figured out what it was about this character that bothered me so much. A fundamental part of the ""thing"" I'm afraid of is that I could not empathize with this character in the present, but I could in flashbacks and the alternate timeline. What breaks me so hard is how 1 just accepts it which is so unrealistic with the only explanation being ""fictional fantasy bullshit"". Quoting this character's dumb catchphrase would give it away but it's essentially just ""shit happens"", referring to some horrific traumatising shit, which is such a shitty moral and the braindead edgelord fanbase eat it up. I saw a thumbnail that was the same shot that I said ""made me the happiest I've felt watching anything"", but now it makes me feel horrible. I instinctively thought I fking hate you, and the person who made this video. I think it was one of that garbage cringe character compilations with music and I'm imagining what that would look like and that video probably picked the scenes I'm worst affected by because they're the most ""epic"". There's a specific screenshot in the show that keeps getting in my recommended and it makes me so sad. I know how extremely selfish that is and I'm so ashamed of it, this is the saddest I've ever felt over anything in my life. I know I'm a fucking moron how I can mistake something this small as something that should be on my mind than a pandemic. I'm extremely helplessly fucking stupid and disappointed in myself. I'm not autistic and I don't have a mental illness or anything. As far as I know, I have nothing mentally wrong with me which I'd rather than be this stupid and difficult to figure out. But if there is and this can go away with medication or something, what might that be? I'm not asking for a Reddit diagnosis, I just want to know what is likely so I can research, just something I can google. I was pretty much done with this talking about this character then as we speak I've become aware of 1's official ending and I don't know how I feel. It made the most sense that if everything in this fictional show went back to normal, I would as well since that's how it started. Something distressing happening in the show and I reacted with distress. But It was a very predictable and open-ended closure that didn't mean a lot to me. Every single optimistic moment I found from this show had been abandoned. Critically I guess it was a masterpiece of an ending but I can't think rationally. As I expected, nothing would have officially ended my feelings of this type of character or person but the ending wasn't as satisfying as I've been building it up the past 2 years in my head. The fact that one of my revenge fantasies I used to cope with came true in the show, spoken by one of the other characters which made me feel so validated, just for it to be forgotten immediately. I've never been this disappointed. Now that I know the ending, I don't know what to think or feel about it yet it still feels like a huge deal. before last year I probably would have loved this ending but I've got so much worse and would satisfy me now is so exaggerated and unpractical. I at least thought that since I've been feeling so much strong emotion there'd be at least some payoff. I'm shaking and sweating and crying right now. What a waste of emotions. And seeing all the fans celebrate this just continues to make me feel so alone. I don't understand how people watch movies. I can't watch fking entertainment.

What's currently motivating me is a character we'll call 3 who I've decided feels worse than 1. While I was watching 1 and 2's show in May 2019, I was watching another show which I found amazing. There was a significant detail that I completely missed in the show that made 3 similar to 1. I really genuinely loved this show and I was looking at character wikis out of interest and accidentally found this detail. It was just a few words that change a lot, except I didn't care at all and still loved this show, it was a great distraction from my current bad feelings about 1. This confirmed to me that I must just have a problem with that show and the two characters exclusive to it, the use of this character trope in anything else won't take away something that I really love. Then it had been exactly a year since I finished watching the show with 3 who at this point wasn't officially on the list. I decided to not watch that show again just to be safe even though I loved it. About 6 months after, I was happy that I got to enjoy it before I got any worse, now, but it had got to the point where my vague memories were enough to get hung up about. I was so desperate for closure and a bit in denial that I made the same mistake with 1 and researched to remind myself what happened and prove my memories wrong. I hoped that I read the wiki wrong or there was a moment of closure that I missed. I got sucked in as usual and read paragraphs that describe every detail, confirming what happened and more. 3 came up relentlessly for the next 5 days which by the end drove me to tears. This show didn't care to portray the type of feelings I was having but rather just show the trope happen as the events play out as it wasn't a focus of the show and not even a main character. It was inevitable and undoable unlike 1. Its been so long since I watched the show that I attempted to fill the gaps between scenes I can remember. One of these scenes I knew had to have happened that I'll call a ""transition"" and I had a disturbing dream about it. In the dream, I was rewatching it on Netflix and my sub-conscience almost tried to create some closure, and I woke up disappointed that it wasn't canon. Since August, 3 has come up occasionally in my mind but only every few months.

Today on a walk for no reason that I could remember, I started thinking about 3. It was worse than usual so I decided to risk looking for opinions on the internet to justify these feelings and found that even though this show gets constant 10/10s, a lot of people don't like it. I clicked on an article listing scenes that were ""too disturbing"", I turned the brightness down so I couldn't see the images or text, I just wanted a glance to see my feelings validated and I don't know why I do this when every time it backfires. Even with the brightness fully down, the third scene listed as the ""transition"" that I had nightmares about, although I had no memory of how the scene went, but this screenshot was definitely the canon event that my brain tried to interpret in that dream. It shows that I've changed two years ago that this scene had such little effect on me to be completely absent from my memory. All I could see was a dark silhouette of a character, and glimpses of a couple of words confirming it was 3. Unfortunately, this little information bridged the gab between the scenes I could remember and how it happened. I was holding my phone as far from my face as possible to attempt to mental gymnastic my way out of it and pretend it's a silhouette of something else but as hard as I tried to deny it, the information was already there. I already saw a glimpse of 3's name which couldn't be the name of another character in the show, I couldn't unread a significant word or unsee the silhouette, what it was implying and on top of that being reminded of the existence of this character next to what I could remember. I tried looking closely at a fraction of the image to see if the hair was a different color to prove it wasn't the same character but the more I looked I could tell it was 3. There was a word that triggers me in any context but this is probably the absolute worst time I've seen this word used. This was on an article calling this event disturbing, even if that justified me feeling this horrible about it, it didn't help and just acknowledged that this really did happen. I know it's not real but an entire team came up with this and were comfortable enough to develop this character through concept art, different design iterations and painstaking animation and not a single one couldn't have been as disturbed as I am and that makes me feel so alone. I can't comprehend how they could all create this story.

I found some scissors and cut as deep in my thigh a few times as hard as I could handle. I've never self-harmed before or felt motivated to but this felt necessary, I wanted to hurt myself as much as I could in the least visible or damaging way. I'm tempted to cut some more right now but I don't want to get carried away. Being an absolute moron, I didn't think about how stupid it was to leave these scares so I cleaned them a bit. This is the first time I've externally done anything significant about my feelings. I couldn't not help cutting myself like most self-harmers say but I wanted to do it and made a decision and I want to do it again.

I have questions. Please tell me what I need, obviously besides therapy. When the circumstances are right, I'll try therapy but that isn't possible for me at the moment. Down to the very basics, what should I do? Should I stop using the internet altogether and continue to never leave the house? Are there healthy ways of coping? Is it better to face my fears or completely isolate myself because neither has worked? This show could easily get a Hollywood remake and become the next Star Wars, what do I do then? What's wrong with me, and what words am I that I can google? I pretty much have no friends or social life, is that the issue? Reddit says it's disenfranchised grief, or I've had a spiritual awakening. I know I'm not insecure, if I was the best at everything ever, I'd still feel the same because these feelings aren't about me, they're mostly about strangers on the internet or made-up people who fit this type of person. Also, it would make me feel a lot better if people understood how stupid this is rather than how valid my feelings are. I need confirmation that I'm not crazy for thinking my feelings are wrong.",throwaway_8634,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ocali5/i_self_harmed_for_the_first_time_i_would/,sure sub

Is it still depression if there's a specific reason for it?,"I've never really been prone to depression - sure, lots of low moments, but nothing that wouldn't count as ordinary human experience.
I've recently entered into recovery for binge eating and find myself extremely depressed. I have no joy in my days, no looking forward to the future - at best i feel empty and at worst I feel tearful. But I'm aware that if i succumbed to my impulses that i wouldn't feel that way. And i dont think that i used binge eating as a way to cope - it was just an extreme addiction. From what i gather, clinical depression does not have a cause - its a chemical imbalance.

Feeling like total garbage. Very stressed out. Wanting to simply find a tree and make a lasso necklace. I'd like to quit life. I can't be good enough.,"Why does this always happen to me?

I am trying my best. It's-of course, OF COURSE it's not good enough! I think I'll have a breakdown soon. I think I'll be on my way out soon. 

I feel like everything I do wrong is a gigantic reflection of the sort of person I am. It further justifies my own disbelief in myself. I can't forgive myself for even my smallest mistakes. I am attacking myself and shaking a bit. Might be the caffeine more than nervous tension, but the tension is 100% there too. 

I'm at work. I don't belong here at work. I should be 6 feet under by now, resting in peace instead of begging for the next hour to come quickly and end my agony. 

I have tried to tell my superiors that I am not sure if I can keep this up for my mental health's sake, but let's be honest. I'm too small to matter. I function even while I'm freaking out internally. Most people have terrible mental health. I'm nothing special so why should I be treated differently? 

Nothing is changing. Nothing seems to matter. Nobody likes me. Nobody cares about me. I want to run into a freeway. I want to beat myself up until I can't breathe anymore. I hate myself. I HATE myself. And I don't blame anyone for feeling the same. 

I'm slow. I'm out of the present, spacing out. I'm a nervous wreck. I'm not a people person. I make too many mistakes. I do things I'm not supposed to. And I forget things more than I remember them. I'm not going anywhere in life because what is the point if I can't adapt? I can't take shouting, or I will collapse into a ball on the floor. 

I hate myself...I'm broken. And I can't work if I'm broken. And I can't be fixed. I'm going to suffer if I keep being alive, no matter what. And I don't know if I can handle...any more suffering.
The pain is so deep...it stings...it squeezes my lungs. 
...I can't cry.
I'm an employee. I need to be a good employee and throw myself away...",VoyagingVulture,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ochjp7/feeling_like_total_garbage_very_stressed_out/,doe always happen trying best course course good enough think breakdown soon think way soon feel like everything wrong gigantic reflection sort person justifies disbelief forgive even smallest mistake attacking shaking bit might caffeine nervous tension tension 100 work belong work 6 foot resting peace instead begging next hour come quickly end agony tried tell superior sure keep mental health sake let honest small matter function even freaking internally people terrible mental health nothing special treated differently nothing changing nothing seems matter nobody like nobody care want run freeway want beat breathe anymore hate hate blame anyone feeling slow present spacing nervous wreck people person make many mistake thing supposed forget thing remember going anywhere life point adapt take shouting collapse ball floor hate broken work broken fixed going suffer keep alive matter know handle suffering pain deep sting squeeze lung cry employee need good employee throw away,feeling like total garbage stressed wanting simply find tree make lasso necklace like quit life good enough,1899,150

How to know if its even depresion or just my fault?,"Basically i have been always a person with bad health, i even needed reanimation in birth. Raised in a family where  criticize and laugh at others  is ""funny"" and the normal, (in the respect i had a lot of luck with my mom, she is totally diferent and a person to be proud of), so i had always a low  self-esteem , and they didnt bother with the ""social part"" of education, basically i had no friends, even with the start of the school, i  I spent recesses alone just thinking in my mental world (to be honest i didint remember so much about the reasons of this one, but i think it was mostly because other kids where mean, basically i wore cheap  clothing , and until like the age of 9 or 10, i didint even care a bit about  comb my hair  and all of that things, i wasnt important for me even in others).

&amp;#x200B;

In secondary things changed a bit, i mean, i was still being bullied for others, they even get expulsed of the institute for that (one day the burned a bit of my hair with a  lighter ), but i did some friends, the problem?, not much later  I felt totally used because people is always there when you're generous but didint stay longer or care much, for example i didint know hoy to swim well (basically the only day i remember going young, my aunt put me in the water holding just my hand, meanwhile the others even my father was just laughing of me having terror and ""drowning "", lesson learned never go out without mom) , and i was always alone at the shore, with noone caring, they just getting in the deep.

&amp;#x200B;

To this point I couldn't say i was the happiest person, but idk, for luck i didint have to much trouble with most of the subjects , i had good grades in the most with just paying atention in class, but with the ""just study this and puke"", i was horrible, i coulndt put me on it, and always ended in tears in front of the books(same with the homework , but this one with more self-blame, and just letting the day without doing anything for the guilt and maybe doing it in the last time of nigth). 

(I had to point that to keep moral, i was mostly playing videogames and that things, was my way of keep mind decent)

&amp;#x200B;

When things started to go worse is that point when you need to know what do you want do with your life, i had zero passion for anything, and to be honest i even lack the desire that i see in others of have things, and make then ""work hard"" for it.

It went worse and worse until it just exploded in university, there i was good in practical subjects( maths and programing), but study that much for the study ones was just imposible, even with the easiest that where just to fill. 

For this point i was living alone in a study, and started to socialice a lot more, even a girl get interested in me, but second year once i started to realize there wasnt future for me in that way, it started nail for nail in my coffing, the girl who show interest in me just changed her mind (it seems she was just getting moral support of ""lot"" of guys, that way i learned if a person say they like you but dont want to   introduce you to other friends is a bad signal),  my stuy started to be full of garbage to the point in ended with flys (the biggest i had seen in my life, proud of them :P), and in the darkest days, just laying in the bed for 3 days barely even driking water of a bottle i have near, i ended getting up when tears where not enough to win, and needed to go for a piss, atleast i didint on the point of piss myself .

  
When i returned to my city, i just ended all the communication with all the people i meet, in part for shame, in part because in the end i didint thing of anyone as a close friend that can understand me, just people to spend my time on ( on the other part i had really good feelings helping others, and lisening them, but in the end i just do it for the self-esteem of being usefull i think).

&amp;#x200B;

Next its just a boring second grade study and work  here and there with my father, at his point anyone that could see me would say i had a perfect life, i mean for luck i didint need to work the  hardest  because  pasive income (all those years of cheap  clothing , no  travels , etc,  were amortized ),  i got a girlfriend, but after 5 years(like 2 of serious  relationship  ) when i wanted to get it real and start a family , she just said no, it apears that my lack of desire in life wasnt good for her, even i lived for her 24h, with a lof of nigths at the phone talking in the bad days, and event doing university works for her in the most stressful days, she said that she where thinking for about a year waiting for me to change of leave me, this hurted me even more, cause i just felt even more used.  

&amp;#x200B;

So here i'm, again rejecting other time every people you would call friends, and letting days just past, because i didint have the desire to do anything, (atleast look the good side, i didint have trouble following corona safety, its going to do like 2 years now of not going with anyone out, doing quarantine before even quarantine existed).

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest i dont know what to really expect from here, but idk, anything would be a help i supose, even knowing that people like me can be really loved, because i think is the only thing i want in life, a person that just stay with you, that return home with you and the end of the day and dont just forget you, a person that do plans with you, (i would just  adapt  at her tastes like i always do with others cause i didint have mines really).

&amp;#x200B;

To end, thanks for your time, and sorry for the bad grammar i'm not a native speaker,  it already feel a little better (yesterday i coulnt sleep a bit, because mental boom at a bit of  anxiety).

&amp;#x200B;

I am so grateful for my parents,"I could not get out of my bed for the past week. Recently school ended, and I am feeling the worst ever. Nothing interests me anymore, usually I play video games but even that held no pleasure for me. A girl I really liked at work recently rejected me, and this made me turn towards suicidal thoughts. I felt a sharp pain in my chest, alongside depression. I did not want to do anything. I told my parents for the first time about my mental health and I was surprised at their reaction. I preconceived the notion that my parents held no value for my mental health, but today I realized the opposite. I told them everything. To my surprise they let me sleep in bed for the entire day. My parents kept checking in on me every hour, making sure my fan was working, making sure I was fed, making sure my room temperature was set properly.

"Just wanted to share my thoughts, i think this is good place to share cause nobody would recognize me irl","I constantly think about how shit i am, how that I'm just a pessimistic, lazy, self-centered, narcissistic, egoistic, loser. My thought always races about how to deal with life, what to do after i graduate college, will i even graduate college, how that i will let my family down, just an overall existential crisis. I spent a lot of time making up scenarios in my mind, and tend to procrastinate a lot too. I also to spent quite some time looking at myself in the mirror while daydreaming and trying to 'make sense' of my face thinking ""i look decent right? At least i have a good look right?"" just to feel good about myself (i know very dumb right)

 I also constantly keep checking up on my social media whenever i post something just to see how people react, how many attention i get, so that I feel good about myself, to get other's recognition/affirmation or whatever just like this reddit post. I always looked for excuses to justify my laziness, inability, and misfortune. I like to self-injure myself (whatever it's called) by biting my hand real hard, cutting my skin with razor and scissor, pinching it with this stainless medical-pinching thingy, to deal with the 'inner pain'. 

I also contradict myself, like by thinking how fuckin dumb i am to cut myself, that i'm overreacting, that im just looking for attention, but i assure myself that I'm not seeking attention to get other's pity, because i never told anyone about it, so I'm good right? my thought always looped like that, it's like 'you're thinking about yourself thinking about yourself thinking' and on and on it goes. Does it make sense? Basically I'm just  a sore pathetic loser who's afraid to do anything and keep making excuses to justify it.

"Still going strong, at least for now","Tl;dr traumatic childhood, shit luck in life


Backstory: I had a very abusive childhood, dad went to prison and mom was going guy to guy and I only remember one that was actually a good guy. I moved in with my grandma who was sick and was on oxygen. For over a year I took care of her before I went to school and after her hospice nurse left at night. I woke up one morning and found her, afterwards I had to move back in with my mom.
Her current boyfriend was on meth and extremely abusive to both of us. I had a fold out bed in the garage with a little desk and a computer that I would play games on to escape. I woke up countless nights to them fighting about sex and cheating and whatever else he could come up with. Me and my mom would pack up and leave and sleep in her car until she brought me to school the next day. We always ended up going back, he broke her arm and I got my ass kicked. She stayed with him.
One week I went camping with a friends family and when I came back they had both disappeared and nobody had seen either of them since I left.
I got put into foster care and eventually found out my mom moved 1500 miles away, I didn’t talk to her for 10 years.

So I have had issues with drugs and alcohol since I was like 13/14. Got expelled from multiple schools and ended up in a continuation school that probably saved my life at that point. That’s where I met my now wife. Once I graduated I started doing better with my depression, life was good, I was working a good job, driving a nice car, beautiful girlfriend… etc… the whole time I was kinda jealous that she had a family that loves her and I don’t, still feel that way.

Jump forward 8ish years. I’m clean except for a couple beers a week, We’re engaged, first baby on the way. I lose my job because the new owner wanted a whole new staff to pay them less. I find a new job that I hate but pays the bills and end up drinking more and more. Baby was born. Our home burned down and all we got out were us and the pets, also we just changed out insurance and it didn’t kick in for that yet so it was a total write off. Then my dog died. Then we moved out of the area and my wife could transfer but I couldn’t so I was out of a job and she was working full time while I watched the baby.

I’m at a point where I feel useless, I don’t feel fit to be a father. I’ve dealt with depression my whole life and this is getting worse than it’s ever been. If it weren’t for my little princess I probably wouldn’t be here at this point. I know I need to be here for her, so she doesn’t deal with what I had to.

I have no family other than hers and my baby that’s too young to understand that daddy’s hurting thankfully, I have no friends because of moving.

I'm scared about college.,"I was just thinking about my time in high school and I feel kinda ashamed by how I handled it. I did terribly in classes and did not know how to improve in them. My social skills were and are bad. I wasn’t really committed to extracurriculars. I just feel scared that in college, I'll just mess things up just as I did in high school. I feel like I'm meant to be a failure and I'm not meant to achieve anything. I'm just scared especially when I hear stories about how professors fail like half the class. Idk why I like just stressing myself out. It's not even like I'm trying to come up with a solution to deal with these hurdles. I mean, I did write up study strategies and academic resources a few days ago. But now, I'm just choosing to stay up at night worrying about the future. I guess I like feeling like I can never become a better person because I won't expect anything from myself. But at the same time, I know my mindset is just unhealthy. It's like I always want to find some problem in my life and stress over it.

I even remember last time, when I went to some summer program at a college, I wasn’t able to make friends. I felt even ashamed of going to the cafeteria to eat alone, so I tried to stay in my room as much as possible.

\--

I know my mindset is the problem, but I don’t know how to ""snap out of it"" sometimes.

I stress and stress. But I don’t do the most obvious of things : Sleep at the right time, don't worry about things you can't change, go eat food at the cafeteria, meet people, etc.

I'm scared I might do the same stupid things when I go to college.

I need advice. How did you prepare for college when having depression?

Do you have a binder for thought patterns or did you do daily self-check-ins? Do you regularly mood-log to identify cognitive distortions or do you do worksheets from a workbook? What has helped the most?

I haven't gotten the habit of doing these sort of stuff, but I'm not sure how many precautions should I have to prevent a slip-up in college.",forgot_username321,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oc70hs/im_scared_about_college/,wa thinking time high school feel kinda ashamed handled terribly class know improve social skill bad really committed extracurriculars feel scared college mess thing high school feel like meant failure meant achieve anything scared especially hear story professor fail like half class idk like stressing even like trying come solution deal hurdle mean write study strategy academic resource day ago choosing stay night worrying future guess like feeling like never become better person expect anything time know mindset unhealthy like always want find problem life stress even remember last time went summer program college able make friend felt even ashamed going cafeteria eat alone tried stay room much possible know mindset problem know snap sometimes stress stress obvious thing sleep right time worry thing change go eat food cafeteria meet people etc scared might stupid thing go college need advice prepare college depression binder thought pattern daily self check regularly mood log identify cognitive distortion worksheet workbook ha helped gotten habit sort stuff sure many precaution prevent slip college,scared college,2010,25

I think my(20f) friend (19f) has a depressive episode and I don't know what to do,"As the title says, I think a friend of mine has a depressive episode (I can tell because I had depression before - now I am on meds and stuff) and I don't know what do because she doesn't answer my calls nor my messages. 

I was actually quite concerned so I called her mother to ask her how's she doing and she said that is a depressive episode again and that she doesn't get out of bed at all. And since it's summer session now, she doesn't study for exams and fails and that also makes it even harder for her. 

As a matter of fact, she had those before, those types of depressive episodes, where she will isolate herself from the whole world and then she will appear out of nowhere and will be completely fine. Those episodes last for about a week or two, max. three weeks. 

I'm just worried that she may do something to harm herself, last time we talked over the phone was a week and a half ago and she was having a panic attack and I managed to calm her down but that's about it.

I advised her to go to my psychiatrist together so that she can get help or go to some therapy, but she declined. 

I just don't know how to approach her since what worked for me as to get my mental health better doesn't work for her and from what I see, she doesn't want help and that makes me really concerned.

I would really appreciate some advice on what to do, because for the first time in my life I am at loss (and we have been friends for 10 years).

P.S. I couldn't go to see her because I had exams packed every 4 days, on Thursday after my last exam

Had thoughts I have not had in years,"Since covid, I have moved home with the goal of working on my relationship with my family. It's never been a good one but figured I am much older, it's been almost 10 years and I can move past things. 

But nothing is different. It's a quiet house and we don't even talk to each other and walk around one another. I'm having thoughts about hurting myself again, something that I haven't thought about in 10 years. 

I would heat up a butter knife and burn my arms &amp; thighs. I am not in counseling and last night was the final push I needed to realize I'm not okay. I have not been happy or experienced anything other dread,sorrow and self pity for the past few years. 

I graduated college, got a well paying job, promotions and did not celebrate any of it.  My family is there for me but I don't trust them or many people in my life. It's becoming a much bigger issue as I get older. I can't keep this up and it's wearing me down. I don't open myself to relationships and stay guarded the entire time. I can't help but feel I make others uncomfortable and it doubles when I realize how uncomfortable I am around people or a new space. 

I have problems I need to work through and am reminding myself I am strong enough to do so. I can't talk about any of this with friends or family because I think im burdening them with issues only I can solve. 

I may sound like a text book case...and that's what makes me realize that these emotions are ""normal"" amongst a certain population of people. I'm working to address the emotion and work through it but it won't go away, it's been years and these feelings have always crept in. 

It's all in my head and I am stronger mentally and physically than before. It's been a weird couple days.

I spent my second year living with some of the best friends I’ve had in my entire life, considering I’ve never really had a best friend before, and they really helped me in my darkest moments.

Depression makes me do stupid things,"  Hello everyone,

First things first, English is not my first language, so my post is probably full of mistakes or inaccuracies (btw feel free to point them out, it’s a good way for me to improve). 

I’ve been suffering from depression for 10 years now (save for high school). I’ve always had ups and downs, but a few weeks ago I was at one my lowest points so far and I decided to take a weight off. My first depression was triggered by some serious bullying in middle school. Since I didn’t tell anyone back then, the culprits weren’t punished, and it prevented me from moving on. 

I knew I couldn’t change the past, but I wanted to do something. Therefore, I created a fake Facebook account and sent a message to the bully who started it all and relentlessly bullied me for 3 years. The message itself wasn’t offensive at all (it was something like “I suffered because of you, I hope you’ve become more empathetic”), my goal was just to leave everything behind me by saying at least something.

However, it turns out I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He sent me like 40 messages, and it seems he mistook me for someone else. From what I’ve read, he’s got some serious issues with his ex (blackmail, death threats, harassment…) and thought that I was her. In his last message, he said that he was going to file a bullying complaint against “me”. I panicked and tried to explain to him that there was a huge misunderstanding about my identity, but he didn’t believe it and he was getting even more aggressive. I deleted my fake Facebook account before things got worse. 

And now I’m afraid of what might happen. I didn’t say anything offensive or illegal, but I don’t know. I’m imagining stuff like the police coming to my house thinking that it was me all along and not his ex and I had my first panic attack after visualizing the scene. More, if I understood correctly, he’s become depressed and suicidal because of what happened with his ex and in one of his messages he said that he would probably kill himself in a few weeks. I know I’m not the one responsible for his situation and although he was (and probably still is) a terrible person, maybe this message took a toll on his mental health, and I feel bad about this possibility. 

I’ve been overwhelmed by everything in the past few months, and I managed to make it worse with this stupid message I sent. Maybe I’m overthinking, but I’ve been panicking a lot since then.

Last year Engineering student about to drop everything,"Last year Engineering student about to drop everything

Hi guys.  I'm new in reddit so I'm sorry  if I make some mistakes while posting this. I could really use your advice. Thank you in advance for reading this. 

I'm in last year of a very difficult engineering degree (at least for me) and I've hated every minute of it. I don't regret studying this at all, and the reason I did it is to have more possibilities of securing a better future abroad(according to me) . All I can think of is how to get out of this country (I'm obsessed, I recognize it)

I've done this last semester online ( like almost everyone in the world). The difference is that I live in a a very complicated country  with almost no internet availability ( No wifi and I can pay just 1GB of data a week, and I'm lucky ) and with that we pretty much just exchange pdf's with our teachers.No conferences, no videos and no zoom. They send us assignments and we answer it. It's been really demanding. 

So with this regime, I've just lied in my bed all day, and I just get up to do a minimum effort to do an assignment and go back to bed. It's really difficult for me to leave my bed even to clean my room or to eat I don't know how to explain it but sometimes I don't even know if it's day or night . I feel like I can't get things done. Doing anything even feels extremely hard. I really hope it's just lazyness but I haven't leave my house in almost a year and a half ( except for when I went to get a covid vaccine)  and I barely leave my room.

I was informed yesterday that I failed a subject (I had taken an exam) and I have to retake it in August. If I fail again I'm going to have to repeat the year. 😢. I feel like I can't take this anymore, I have like 3 subjects more I'm doing assignments of, and I am supposed to have some advancements in my thesis and I haven't written a word, I'm basically ghosting my tutor. And I don't have any friend I can rely on. 
I'm so obsessed with just graduating and getting the fuck out of here that I haven't realized that I might not even graduate. I need to know how to be focus in the present and in what I have to do and not in the uncertainty of the future, I get really ansious about this.
I don't know if I'm overreacting at the heat of the moment but I feel like I can't get things done. 
And I feel like wherever I look there are just bad news, empty store shelves empty, pharmacy shelves, covid cases going up, now besides all of our problems there's a fucking hurricane coming our way, like how tf people stay hopeful.

"Ex-BF Cheated, admitted to hurting me purposefully throughout the relationship and overall neglected me","I'm not sure if breakup stories are allowed but im just at my wits end and I don't know where else to post this.

He knew that even before this relationship I had extremely low self esteem, harmed myself multiple times and was about to be sent to a psych ward. He said he would take care of me, love me forever and never hurt me again like the ones before did. 

After a few months of having a wonderful relationship it started, he cheated on me, noticed that I forgave him and thought ""oh wow i can do everything and she would forgive me"" (thats his own words) from then on he wouldn't even care about hurting me anymore in anyway. I moved in about 3 years later, still affected by him cheating on me but very very slowly getting better but then even though we lived together he started ignoring me, preferred playing with his friends over doing ANYTHING with me and more stuff that just hurts too much to write.

And when I then finally got the courage to break-up because it all just made me feel worse he dared to say that my love for him was never the ""same"" as his love for me, that I lied about loving him forever and that every future relationship I had would be like cheating on him. He tried to make me come back to him by threatening me with suicide the night I broke up.

Counselling recommended!,"I had my first counselling session yesterday. I was weirdly calm, considering I had a big panic attack when going to the doctors the day before! I think it was because I knew counselling is what I need and that it will help me. 

It went really well, we actually have a lot in common! She asked me what I wanted when the sessions ended- I said I wanted to feel that I wasn’t crazy and also a letter that says I’m sane like they do on all the films. 

I cried on her-lots!

I laughed with her- a bit. 

I realised I was probably born in the wrong era-most of my morals are from the 1930s, like keeping private life on the down low (no arguments outside, that kind of thing)

I told her most things (we couldn’t cover all the bases as I had already gone over my time by half hour!) I had a major headache all day afterwards but she said that may happen. I also slept like a baby, something that hasn’t happen for AGES!

"Remember, have a friend to go to a female classmate home called on me, went to the female classmate home, found her home classmate quite many. I didn't care about it either. Maybe my ears were sharp that day. I heard one girl say to another girl, ""He is so ugly, why do you ask him to play here? The","The other side of the girl said, I didn't call him, it is estimated that XX (my friend) called him to it. They were quite far away from me and they were very quiet. I don't know how I heard it. I don't think my friend heard it. After I listened to what did not say to my friend said, I do not go to my mother do not let me play too long, just shan of go. Back at home I looked in the mirror, look, so has been looking at. Gradually, the eyes moist. This is the first time I've ever cried because of how I look. Am I just that ugly? Even my classmates say that about me? Then a mistaken idea arose that good grades were not what mattered. Later days always very care about their appearance, class also absentminded. There was no return. When I see my classmates look at me every day, I never dare to look directly at them. From then on, I walked farther and farther with my classmates and became more and more introverted. So every day silently by their eyes, want to finish junior high school early. Finally graduated from junior high school, high school, I thought there would be a new life. But only a high, that I fell ill to treatment, when I came back, I found that the position was transferred. New deskmate (high school three years has been together the best friend, later because of my unintentionally study results but with him almost he did not I am his friend, the second semester of high school three mid-term exam results come out after no longer talk to me. Told me ""Ben moved you."" I said, ""Oh, what's the reason?"" ""JD says you smell like hell."" I smell it on my body. It doesn't smell! Ask the deskmate ""do I smell?"" ""No,"" my deskmate told me. I asked the original table ""we sit so long high, smell my body have flavor?"" ""No."" And then he looked at me, and then I got it, and he said because you're ugly, you're sitting in front of JD. Later I wanted to find the old class theory, did not expect the old class to find me first. He called me outside and said, CZ, you need to shower more. My classmates say you smell. I want to retort, because become introverted, dare not talk to the teacher. He went on to say, you are so ugly and your grades are so bad, you should learn more from JD. I'm third in my class this time. Math first. Here I know, ha ha, the original teacher also think we grow ugly, I understand the feeling of those poor students, once the results of the teacher is not care about your dignity. On my way home, I was in a temper with my mother. My mother asked me what was wrong, and I answered truthfully. My mom just said, ugly is ugly. Let it be. I was ugly in my mother's eyes. I entered the bathroom, shower head dripping water, with tears down. This is me again because of appearance cry, cry so heartache, also cry so no concern, maybe because of the shower water. Is it really wrong to be ugly? Because appearance is not wrong also be to want to enclose error? Made it through high school like junior high again. Now that I'm in college, today, I'm crying again. I never had a date at school because of my looks, but everyone wants a date. Then I want to fall in love online. I thought it would be hard to find a partner, but it was easy to find. She spoke to me sincerely, and I gave her my heart. He asked me for a picture and I never gave it to him. She said she didn't mind. I'm glad she is. So a year down, we are very sincere to each other, said to each other do not care about each other's appearance. Then we met, and when she saw me, there was a definite change. In fact, she was also really ugly, but I didn't say anything, or in the previous online attitude to her, because I think I can not look at her. As long as the heart is enough. Back to the dormitory in the evening, I found that her friends, I added her (I back her account), she did not agree, in the refusal of reply I said, you are too ugly, ugly than me, you also talk about the object? . I did not go to add her, I quietly a person thinking, because the roommate in, I went to the bathroom. I cried, crying pain, like the heart was crushed. Why is the heart worth nothing. Is ugly really my fault? Even an ugly girl like that doesn't like you. Heart aches.

I was doing so well and I think I’m back to square one- so much has happened,"I think I need to explain everything before I can fully express how empty I feel right now. 

Not that long I meet a guy, that I’ve already previously talked about before, who knew he would have such a significant impact on me when everything was short lived. 

Anyways I meet him in a rough time and I think I used him as a distraction to the chaos of emotions that I felt. Now this is already bad I know but to make it even worse he wasn’t the best. He would purposely try to make me feel/look stupid and at one point told me that I “lacked common sense” all to which I would brush off. And thats not the problem because these things that he would do towards me really wouldn’t affect me. I knew that his opinion of me was of little value. So why even go back? Well I think my problem is that I’ve never truly felt loved by someone and although he verbally sucked he offered comfort in the forms of physical touch. I’m not naive or stupid I knew that to him I was seen as someone dumb but usable. This was later proven true when he randomly stopped texting me which again didn’t hurt. 

What did hurt was the fact that in that short amount of time I became dependent on the physical touch that made me feel not so empty and sad. So when that stopped I truly felt devastated. Which is a weird thing might I add, crying not for a person but what that person could provide. 

But let me further explain, he didn’t know that I’m dealing with depression and that whenever it came to us cuddling and him kissing me it felt like I was whole. It made me forget everything because this was something that I never experienced and found out I loved. My mom /family was never the one to show affection especially if it was physical. I couldn’t tell you of a time that I hugged or that my mother hugged me, she also was never the one to verbally demonstrate affection. So when I started to feel affection it became really emotional for me. I never knew how much I needed that/ was deprived of. 

Funny because I’ve always dealt with my depression alone and although he never knew it those few days that we were together i didn’t feel so lonely. 

Anyways the aftermath of that was even worse than I had originally been in. I felt alone and empty and like the whole weight of my sadness was back on me. I spent it the first few days trying to convince myself that I was fine before I gave in and fully allowed myself to feel sad. The sadness lasted a while and for a minute I thought that was my breaking point. But one day I got up and told myself I no longer wanted to deal with my depression and for some reason I began to feel better, there was a couple of things that I knew would trigger me and I purposely avoided them. 

Yet for some reason today I began to go through the whole motions of feeling alone and it came back really hard. At this point it hurts to open up to others so I don’t know what to do.",junnie6,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oc6puc/i_was_doing_so_well_and_i_think_im_back_to_square/,think need explain everything fully express empty feel right long meet guy already previously talked knew would significant impact everything wa short lived anyways meet rough time think used distraction chaos emotion felt already bad know make even worse best would purposely try make feel look stupid one point told lacked common sense would brush thats problem thing would towards really affect knew opinion wa little value even go back well think problem never truly felt loved someone although verbally sucked offered comfort form physical touch naive stupid knew wa seen someone dumb usable wa later proven true randomly stopped texting hurt hurt wa fact short amount time became dependent physical touch made feel empty sad stopped truly felt devastated weird thing might add cry person person could provide let explain know dealing depression whenever came u cuddling kissing felt like wa whole made forget everything wa something never experienced found loved mom family wa never one show affection especially wa physical tell time hugged mother hugged also wa never one verbally demonstrate affection started feel affection became really emotional never knew much needed wa deprived funny always dealt depression alone although never knew day together feel lonely anyways aftermath wa even worse originally felt alone empty like whole weight sadness wa back spent first day trying convince wa fine gave fully allowed feel sad sadness lasted minute thought wa breaking point one day got told longer wanted deal depression reason began feel better wa couple thing knew would trigger purposely avoided yet reason today began go whole motion feeling alone came back really hard point hurt open others know,wa well think back square one much ha happened,2901,76

"It's hard to be the eldest. At this moment, I want to end everything.","I am now currently 20, female. And for the past few months, life for me has been really hard. I was 18 when my mom died and since then, I stood as the mother of the family, because my father seems to only work and goes home to either eat, bath, or sleep. It's been so hard since I am now in college and at the same time tending to the needs of my younger siblings, the younger one is a senior high school, while the youngest in elementary.

I feel it suffocating, there are times where my father doesn't give money leading me to find ways to have some just to survive the month. I want to enjoy my younger years but it seems that I was given a heavier responsibility and I can't get away with it. Bills needed to be paid, food needed for survival, also some debts to pay. I want to work, but there are a lot of circumstances hindering me to do so. 

We only stay at our grandmother's house (my mom's mother) and don't even own one. There are times where we fight because of the financial matters. With that, for the past 2 years, those exhausted me, and the effects are quite visible now. My academic performance was affected, I became more introverted, I feel trouble sleeping and then overslept or vice versa, I don't have appetite to do anything, I only eat once or twice a day (because I am always nagged to do so), but if I am not reminded, I don't eat for the whole day.

As I am writing this, I am crying, I have no one to tell these struggles, I want to see a psychologist or seek any medical help, but I don't have money. I have quite few friends and it's just that, I just don't want to reach out to them.

Life is Beating Me Down,"I’m 21 years old and about to be a 5th year senior in university. This all started about 2 weeks after I turned 20 in September 2019. I came down with catastrophic health problems. This wasn’t anything common, but it wasn’t life threatening…to other people that is. One day I woke up, and everything was just different. I’ll start with the day that everything changed; or when I noticed it changed. (Even though this was almost 2 years ago, I remember it like it was an hour ago)

**The Day Everything Changed**

It was a regular weekday and started with my normal routine. No breakfast, shower, watch a little YouTube and then I went to class. I always arrive to class early, and when I used to wait for the professor to arrive, I’d read some news on my phone. But while I’m reading, I notice everyone around me starts acting weird. It was only a couple of people in the class, but they were all acting the same. They were sniffing and rubbing their noses, making comments like “do you smell that” and “it smells like shit.” But when they sniffed and rubbed their noses, it was in my direction. So I try to smell it, but I don’t smell anything. Eventually I smell something a little bit, but I couldn’t smell anything that irritate me the way it irritated the other students. By this point, I knew it was me. You ever just get that feeling? But then something happened to prove my hypothesis. I look to my right, and this guy 2 seats over from me is giving me the nastiest look and sniffing. He face was of pure disgust. I had never seen anyone look like that, let alone at me. The image of his face is something I’ll never forget. I try to sit through class, but it gets harder and harder and my anxiety keeps skyrocketing. When the professor came to my side of the room, she jumped at the smell and tried to play it off. After this, a lizard was on the whiteboard for some reason, and you know how students are. I used that opportunity to run to my dorm. When I got to why dorm, I took three showers that. Nothing changed. 

2 days later, I ditch school and go home early one morning, and tell my dad everything that happened. He told me I could go to the doctor, so I went. They gave me no answers. I’ll sum this part up. This is basically when I learned that my parents weren’t invincible and all knowing. In essence, they just wanted me to suck it up, even though they didn’t say it that way. Its easy to say that when you don’t have to deal with on the daily basis. I stayed home for a week, asking my family did they smell anything but they said no, which was probably true at the start. But eventually I noticed them rubbing their noses and making remarks about the smell, even though they aren’t directed at me. At one point, I knew they were lying to me and I didn’t know how to feel. I understood why but I also felt betrayed. I was confused. At first I couldn’t smell the odor at will, but over time I could. I wont get too gross, although it may be a little too late for that. 

I tried to say strong, but I couldn’t. Each day and every-time I had to deal with people, a piece of me was destroyed. I stopped going to class and layed in my dorm room staring at the sealing for 5 months straight. The neighbors on my hall would beat on walls, yell , and call be names through the window. I ate apples, ramen noodles, and only drunk water because I was too scared to go to the cafeteria. Eventually, I started living in my car in parking lots. Sleeping in it as well. I couldn’t escape no matter where I went. 

Over this time span, I visited about 7 or 8 clinics. I told one doctor my symptoms, and he literally asked me “what do you want me to do??” He gave me some anxiety meds and basically told me f off. Around December, a doctor diagnosed me with hemorrhoids. I finally learned what was causing this. At least I thought I did. 

I continued experiencing the same situation in the Spring of 2021, and then covid happened. During this time, I literally just hid in room depressed. Although this depression was not nearly as bad as it was when I was alone in my dorm room. It was so hard to live with myself. I didn’t want to be in the same room as myself, and I still don’t. I didn’t spend time with my family because I don’t want to see them rub their noses. I felt guilty for not spending time with them and I still am. I don’t know, I think I’m just weak or something. 

Eventually, in July of 2020, I ended up going to a gastroenterologist. (I should have went here first, but didn’t know how doctors worked, in terms of specialist and stuff). This guy tells me they were bad and I need surgery. Fast forward to December 2020, I get a Hemorrhoidectomy in hopes of solving the problem. And I had another in May of 2021. I still have the smell problem, which doesn’t make sense. 

And now we are in the present day. Throughout this all, I have become a social recluse. I stopped talking to my friends because I knew that they wouldn’t accept me like this. I couldn’t confront them like this. In this pathetic state. The pandemic was helpful in the sense that I could take courses online, now I don’t how to proceed. I can’t sit in class smelling like this. I don’t know what to do. I was thinking about just dropping out and leaving, or trying to get an internship and move out or something.  

I feel like I am a shell of my old self, and I don’t think I can get back there. Looking back, I don’t know how I haven’t offed myself yet. I think I’m too stubborn. But I also don’t want my family to mourn and experience something like that. I want to see my friends again and spend time with my family. I haven’t even had a gf yet.

"[Progress]It’s taken a long time, but I’m finally starting to like the person I am.","I’ve been depressed since the age of 11. Admitted to multiple mental hospitals, several therapists, 2 wilderness therapy trips, and almost a decade wasted on RuneScape. Around 6 months ago I decided I wanted to stop spending all my time on a game and actually live my life. 

Quitting video games was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I lost my community, my purpose in life, my self worth, and a huge part of my identity. Over the following weeks I’d develop severe anxiety, body dysmorphia, and a dangerously high blood pressure. I’d spend days without moving at all, with my brain on a constant loop thinking about what a piece of shit human being I was. 

Despite how much easier my life was while playing video games, I didn’t want to give up and return to where I was, so I kept pushing myself. My biggest hurdle was having absolutely no confidence in myself or my social ability. People would try to start conversations with me, and I lived in constant fear of disappointing them or wasting their time. This led to some really painful social interactions that would make me want to give up and hide, like I should accept that I’ll just be alone forever. 

Eventually I realized that it doesn’t make sense to give other people that much control over my happiness. I set a goal for my life that I’m confident I can achieve, to give me something to think about other than my loneliness. I got a job, started going to the gym regularly, and I’ve used my free time to develop my programming skills. Knowing that I’m working towards a goal does 2 things: it helps you feel good about the work you put in each day, and it allows you to care less about other people’s opinions. Since developing this mindset I’ve had so much more fun talking to people! Sure, I say awkward shit almost constantly because I have aspergers and my processing speed isn’t the fastest, but I don’t let it get me down. When people can tell you’re enjoying a conversation, they’ll try to talk to you more regardless of whatever awkward shit you say. 

It’s been a horrible, horrible journey but I genuinely like the person I am now. I see my good qualities more clearly than my negative ones. I wake up most mornings excited for what I get to do that day. 

Good luck for everyone battling with depression, unless you’ve been through it it’s really hard to understand just how terrible depression is. The most important thing I’ve learned is you can never give up. You’ll have days that go so poorly you just want to put a bullet in your head and end all this bullshit. The hardest thing to do is to push past those feelings, understand tomorrow is a new day with new possibilities. And usually, the next day won’t be as bad (it might even be a good day!) individual days won’t be as bad if you can just focus on the progress you’ve made.",joefred44,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oc444x/progressits_taken_a_long_time_but_im_finally/,depressed since age 11 admitted multiple mental hospital several therapist 2 wilderness therapy trip almost decade wasted runescape around 6 month ago decided wanted stop spending time game actually live life quitting video game wa hardest thing ever done lost community purpose life self worth huge part identity following week develop severe anxiety body dysmorphia dangerously high blood pressure spend day without moving brain constant loop thinking piece shit human wa despite much easier life wa playing video game want give return wa kept pushing biggest hurdle wa absolutely confidence social ability people would try start conversation lived constant fear disappointing wasting time led really painful social interaction would make want give hide like accept alone forever eventually realized make sense give people much control happiness set goal life confident achieve give something think loneliness got job started going gym regularly used free time develop programming skill knowing working towards goal doe 2 thing help feel good work put day allows care le people opinion since developing mindset much fun talking people sure say awkward shit almost constantly aspergers processing speed fastest let get people tell enjoying conversation try talk regardless whatever awkward shit say horrible horrible journey genuinely like person see good quality clearly negative one wake morning excited get day good luck everyone battling depression unless really hard understand terrible depression important thing learned never give day go poorly want put bullet head end bullshit hardest thing push past feeling understand tomorrow new day new possibility usually next day bad might even good day individual day bad focus progress made,progress taken long time finally starting like person,2813,83

Im Lost in my own world,"like my username might suggest I am a real deep thinker, i otherthink stuff, then get sad and lonely.

there is just no silence, its seems to get louder and louder..

Mostly in already fucked up situations i think and think about the situation, if it was my fault, my memory is better than average i can remember stuff most of the other have already forgotten. photographic memory doesnt make it better, for example the one time my friend almost got killed in a streetfight. Its just stacking up

I kind of dont fit in, my few friends are the same way but still in a way better place. I think they just meet me on a regular basis to keep my sanity. Therapy is no option, to this point it only made everthing worse.

Since I was little it felt like everybody just wanted to fuck me up, this is the reason why i think this life could be a stupid test in an bigger simulation, like Darwin, but just on a Sci-fi lvl.

I get Anxious/Depressed because:

&amp;#x200B;

* My father doesnt make it better, havent seen him in 1.5 y and the first time i got on the phone he only makes me feel like I made something wrong, eventhough everybody tells me he is wrong i cant believe myself, neither them.

&amp;#x200B;

* Spending most my time coding stuff that after I finish them, turns out to exist allready, ore even better beeing 100x times better then my stuff. So I am called a copycat, deleting it, smoking pot, drinking, and starting all over again.

&amp;#x200B;

* loneliness is not the biggest problem, more like not beeing understood and beeing marked as the guy how loves his computers more than going out. Girls kind of beeing jerks, i dont say its probably not my issue, but no one wants to take time to talk to me. I think they mostly dont like introverts in my Area.

&amp;#x200B;

* My sister wants to kill herself, eventhough she said to her therapist its not my fault, it kind of feels like its mine, Im the bigger brother.

&amp;#x200B;

* I get real Anxious when im at bigger parties, its a feeling like dying, like my life is fading, nicotine seems to help in about 90% of the time, but I dont have the money to buy hundrets of cigarets.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont want to kill myself, but i think my depression diagnosed from childs-doctor 5 years ago is going worse and worse, without out weed im never happy, even when its seems so.

The “For Now” Friend,"Everyone always leaves. No one is ever permanent in my life. It just feels like I’m forever going to be the “for now” friend. I only ever get asked to hangout because I own a car or someone wants to smoke. No one ever wants to just spend time with me if there’s no incentive. I feel worthless. I feel used. Even in my last relationship, I was just a placeholder. I kept mentioning my needs and how I felt about the situation just to be ignored. What I need doesn’t matter. I will always be “too much”. I can’t unhear the words he said about the relationship. “it’s too high maintenance” was it? Or were you just giving less than the bare minimum to me and giving your all to everyone else. I notice everything. I hate it. I hate that I’m not “good enough” to even be considered a “forever” friend or partner. Im tired of being walked over. I’m tired of feeling worthless.

I’m lonely but I shut ppl out,"The most frustrating feeling is staring at my screen four hours everyday, wanting to reach out, thinking of someone I miss and love and do nothing but stare at our conversation until the sun goes down. It’s so lonely to immediately think of the same person when you’re happy, sad, bored, whatever and the moment you have their attention, words stop coming out. It’s even more frustrating to constantly need validation then when you receive it, it goes in one ear out the other. I always think I’m fine but when I break down over the smallest thing I can’t stop crying.

How did you tell your kids about your self harm/past?,"I(f15) don’t have kids, I’ve always wanted kids and I plan to have some when I’m older and find the right partner. Life hasn’t been the kindest to me thus far and I have plenty of scars to prove it. My struggle with self harm has left my body very blatantly marked up.

I know I can move past it all even though it’s just really hard right now.

My question to you, parents, is, how did you or do you plan to tell your children about these types of things? How do you explain self harm to a kid?

Any Advice?,"Disclaimer, I'm on a throwaway.

I come from a household where there is a lot of stigma and lots of shaming for anything relating to mental illness where there's a lot of the ""why can you just do it"" and the ""thanks I'm cured"" kind of attitude, so I haven't been medically diagnosed yet (I'm a teen (M) ), but I believe I might have some symptoms of depression. I've always thought I'd had it, so I thought it would be good to talk about coping advice with other people and recieve some validation rather than live in a kind-of limbo where I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really ""close"" to any members of my family because honestly, they haven't always been the greatest to me. For example when I was kid I quickly learned not to trust my parents because they would use things I said against me or punish me not so great ways, and this fallout would last in a week of screaming, crying, hiding etc. They don't even know what I like to do, my hobbies, and my skills etc. It's been better as a teen, but still I can't work off the past, so I often feel ""trapped"" or ""alone"". Their actions and behaviors definately manifested a lot of anxiety in me, and it took years before I could actually look people in the face (I still struggle to do that). Anyways, I think this might have been a large part in creating my supposed depression, but honestly I have no clue.

&amp;#x200B;

Nowadays I have like waves of ""trances"" (if that's what I could call them?) where for days at a time I can't make myself do anything and I lose motivation (even taking a shower is hard) and I often can't make myself make food even if I'm hungry. In these periods I sleep like 18+ hours everyday until I have coldsweats and my parents always belittle me for being lazy, even though I feel horrible. The worse thing is that I'm losing motivation for things I like to do, and I just stare at the ceiling and feel bad about not doing anything. I just feel ""stuck/traped"" or ""in a dream"", if that makes sense? Like I wanna runaway/just not exist anymore. I also don't really ""feel"" anything? Like everything's just gray and uninteresting and I am not, per se, ""sad"", but I'm not like happy either.  I also recently heard about high-functioning depression and that really struck a chord with me. I appear pretty normal to my friends and ussually I can get things done, but right now it's gotten harder.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, because it's not diagnosed I can't get any kind of treatment, so I would love to have tips on how to just try to make it through? Personally I found daydreaming and just staring at the sky to be a bit effective, but I don't think that's a healthy coping mechanism...

Just want to quit,"TW - Graphic description of abuse

I was brought up in a pretty abusive household. My childhood memories are filled with memories of domestic violence, abuse, and manipulation. For around the first 15 years of my life, I saw gore and blood on an almost daily basis. I often remember seeing my mom bleeding from her head after being hit with a pan, I've seen an almost severed and dangling finger, seen a person temporarily blinded by trauma to the eye, seen someone have a cardiac arrest and all of this has sort of brutalized me. Add to this manipulative abuse by a person that forbade me to leave home or have friends or talk back or dissent. 

I grew up isolated from people, connecting to the world via the internet, and became introverted over time. I hate being controlled and abused, but my feelings have become so numbed I am not really sure I can say I care for others. I just want to get away, beyond the reach of the person that has abused and controlled me so far. I have grappled with depression on and off for a couple of years, starting from the time I was 17.

The only thing going for me is an education that helps me fend for myself since I had to perform really well to be not abused for being a loser. I had to choose to study something I had no interest in and then again was coerced to pursue an MBA from a premier B school. My dad, the person that's been controlling me up until now, is pretty upbeat that I'm doing really well and wants me to pursue a rewarding career and marry a woman pretty soon. While I do believe he thinks he's doing what's best for me, I am just done.

I'm too brutalized to want to love a woman. In fact, I feel nothing but contempt for women. I dunno why. There's just too much repressed anger within that I can't ever allow to be seen. Whenever other folks at home talked back to my dad, it would invariably end in hours of violence unleashed on my mom followed by unceasing verbal abuse. This ensured I never dared to talk back. I've now internalized this habit and there's just no way I can express anger towards the person that abused me.

Do I hate my dad? I do. Do I want to take it out on him? I couldn't care less. I do not care for people anymore. I do not want to be reconciled. I do not want to be a family. I want to be left alone. I want distance and peace. I'm just so traumatized that I don't think I can stand the depressing rigor of a management career. I can't work long hours without wanting to kill myself. I'm already too broken to endure.

I don't make friends that easily. My social skills suck. It's not even that I like most people I see. I'm just too different from them. I'm filled with anger and hate. 

I am now saddled with a loan thanks to the MBA. I plan to pay off the loan and just drop off the map. I can always make enough to sustain myself. I'm not gonna marry, not going to rise up the career ladder. I'm going to try to find the will to live.

Is this the fault of God? God doesn't intervene that much in real life, does he? People do get murdered in the most gruesome ways one can imagine. It's up to me to avoid pain.

"I'm horrible, confidence is a bitch to get.","God, I've been trying my best to work kn my confidence. But it can never work, which makes me question if I'm truly really a man or not.

Being me (17M) is the worst, man. Being overweight, horrible voice, not athletic at all, with no necessary skills or talent, do you know how hard it is to get confidence as the way I am? I've been even trying to go to the gym or even exercise, but it's so embarrassing knowing my family even fucking teases me about it. And as many times as I asked my parents about the gym, they just usually forget it. 

It definitely doesn't help the fact I failed my current school year thanks to taking virtual classes, and now I'm most likely going to lose most of my friends, and get judged much, much more.

I wanna make myself better, but it's so hard to focus on that, as well as other things like my school is reopening soon. That's going to shorten my time so much. I dont know what to do. I hate myself. I hate being me. I can barely name anything good about myself. To be honest, sometimes I just wished I never fucking existed.

I have no friends because I pushed them all away.

Struggling a lot with overthinking things. Need honest advise,"Probably my biggest fantasy is to not have my guard up 24/7 with everyone. Being able to open up to someone, or rely on someone.

Now there are two major problems with this. Firstly, will this ever happen? Will I ever be normal enough to let it happen? Or will I scare away everyone with my insecurities and psychological problems.
Secondly, if this does happen, is it really wise to let your guard down with anyone? The vast vast majority of people are assholes, waiting for a chance to take advantage of you, what are the odds the person I let my guard down to won't be one? Not great tbh. And why would anyone even wanna carry my mental burdens? What does anyone owe me to begin with? Why would anyone put themselves through it for me?

It seems of someone is willing to go through with it, it is unlikely they're doing it for me. Odds are they're gonna use whatever they get against me eventually.

So a major question that arises is, is it even worth it, to think about and seek companionship? Is the burden on my brain worse, or is the risk of someone taking advantage of me, and leaving me ten times as broken and insecure worse?

And that leads us to the most important question. Is any of it worth it to begin with? Is living worth it? If both the outcomes of the game end in tremendous/prolonged suffering, why play at all? Is it not the humane thing to do to just put myself out of this misery early on?

I am a 25 yo female and can't see myself becoming a healthy independent woman.,"I dealt with a lot of emotional abuse/neglect growing up. I've been on and off medicine since I was 15. I have been isolated, lonely, and friendless for several years now. I've just recently graduated college which is a huge accomplishment for me considering all my mental health issues. After graduation, I've developed even worsening anxiety and depression. I've started experiencing severe insomnia. I feel totally mentally disturbed. I have no real support. The absolute best thing for me would be to independent, living off on my own, maybe get myself a cat and start working towards the ""next steps in life."" However, I have a deep deep feeling that I am not capable of being on my own. Right now I live at home and I get such extreme feelings of anxiety if I am left alone for one night. What makes matters worse is that my mom, who I live with, leads me to feel like a burden for everything I'm going through. She tells me it's hard to want to be around me when I'm like this. If I'm not happy and cheery, she wants nothing to do with me. She's never met me with any empathy meanwhile I am there to give her comforting words when she is feeling down. She knows how lonely I am. My dad calls me a ""wounded bird"" behind my back so there's that... It's so hard to feel so tied to an environment that's not good for me. The simple answer would be be off on my own but I don't know how I could be with all the mental and emotional problems I have. I get panic attacks just being too far away from my house... It's all so frustrating it makes me not to want to be here anymore. I wish so badly I could live like a ""normal"" woman in her 20s...

My dog is my anchor.,"Sometimes I hold his big, mushy face in my hands and he gazes up at me with brown eyes full of adoration, in an almost human-like way. Then I think to myself, ""I can't believe I tried to leave you here all alone.""

And sometimes even when I try to push that guilt away and convince myself that he'd be fine, he has other family members to feed him and tend to his needs, I find myself hesitating, thinking of him waiting for me to come back.

It might feel stupid that he's my reason to keep fighting (I don't feel like that phrase applies to me though, as all I'm doing is waking up every day) I guess a reason is a reason.

Each passing day I want to scream at just how awful this world really is,"I think it’s easy for us all to grow complacent in the face of our world and its ongoings. It’s so easy to grow numb, letting each tragic event become just another passing news story. We as individuals couldn’t possibly shoulder every wrong of this world. It makes sense that we’d grow to emotionally adapt to it. However, the little things I witness always put it back into perspective. I’m witnessing a young relative of my father’s girlfriend, being told by her mother to visit all sorts of college campuses despite the family offering no financial support to her. Her household is abusive and she’s being strung along by her parents without a clue. It enrages me knowing how they’d treat her in such a way. It breaks my heart knowing that, in time, she’s going to be thrust into a very harsh reality. I recognize this train wreck waiting to happen and it reminds me of just how many more cases exactly like this one or worse are out there. Kids are born into households without a chance. Life is a roulette wheel of unfortunate circumstances and the lack of meaning just tops it all off. Putting this back into perspective terrifies me.

Question: How do i make friends when everybody hates me?,"Im 16F and I feel like I'm drowning in loneliness. Something bad happened to me, something traumatic. And once people from my school found out, they took it as a public service to ruin my life further and trigger trumatic episodes for me. Why? Because they think i'm lying. I wish they realized the pain and suffering they're causing me, purely because of their selfish needs to get involved and pick sides without hearing my own. Innocence is bliss huh. The situation isn't a light one either, and I'm getting told that it'll just go away, people will forget. I know they wont, they're going to linger for the rest of my schooling years. I'm considering dropping out, although it's been a dream of mine to get into University for years. I just don't know what to do. I don't want this situation to get the better of me, to ruin my life and let them win, but I feel so weak, and I don't know if I'm strong enough. I'm spending the entirety of my two week break at home, watching youtube for hours on end, typically podcasts, it makes me feel slightly less alone. I feel like I'm going to stay this lonely for a long time, all my friends have left me because I'm the accused liar. It hurts. 

I'm getting therapy for this, and its going to take a long time for me to heal, if ever. I just feel like I should be spending my break going out with friends and doing shit, instead I'm just sitting in my own self pity.

I’ve been suicidal since I was 14 and it’s gotten worse,"
I’ve been suicidal since I was 14 (I’m 16 now) I pretty much think about it everyday. I just feel like my whole life is worthless and hopeless, I had a pretty shitty childhood my mum didn’t really care what I did and my dad died when I was 9. After that my mum was addicted to drugs so she could barely take care of me. I have a disabled brother so he’s basically the focus of everything I never get any attention from my mum. I don’t remember the last time she said she loves me or hugged her, I just wish I had someone who actually loved me. I’ve lost all of my friends because apparently I’m a dick but I don’t know how suppose I just try to push everyone away. I don’t know how I’m supposed to get anywhere with life I haven’t been to school since 14 too, my mum stopped me from going around the time I started having suicidal thoughts I guess that was the ignition of it. Now all she does is lay down all day and do nothing sometimes I have to go days without eating. I’m just so sick of this, everyone i tell never takes me seriously. I wish someone would help me I feel so hopeless and lost at this point it feels like suicide is the only option. My “best friend” he even says to me he thinks I’m never gonna have a job or succeed to anything in life so realistically what’s even the point in trying if the one person I trust even believes my worst fear.

Advice,"Hi - 22(M)

For obvious reasons I didn’t go into work the next day. I also didn’t go into work today because it was a national holiday.

My whole life I'm told not to worry about what others think...,"Then I mention how desperately I just want to die, how absolutely tired I am of existing and suddenly it's ""think of how everyone else would feel!"" 

For once in my damn life I don't care how everyone else would feel. This isn't about everyone else, this is about me.  Some say suicide is a selfish act and you know what? In this case they're right. I'm not going to continue dragging myself through every impossible day doing the same useless nothing over and over and over again, in physical and mental pain because I woke up that morning just because you'd feel sad for a while. 

Maybe you should feel sad now. I literally am begging for help but I can't afford the nearly $200 a month to see a therapist let alone the cost of medication. My husband said I can't get help because we just can't afford it so what am I supposed to do? You know what would save money? One less fat useless fucking mouth to feed. Therapist says I can't work, I can't try for disability unless I go to the therapist and I can't go to the therapist because we can't afford it. 

I told my husband on a phone call just now that I'm just focusing on not killing myself today. He brushed it off to keep talking about what he was talking about.

I told my mom I can't even take my diabetic meds because every time I pick them up I have the urge to take the whole bottle and it scares me.

She made a joke about how it would give my roommates PTSD if I killed myself.

I don't feel like I have a future anymore.,"I'm seventeen and everyone around me seems excited to live their lives. I go to parties and everyone's talking about college and what jobs they want to get and just the future in general. Everyone seems so optimistic. I see people hear on Reddit talking about how they started out excited for their futures, but I've never been. I'm going to a community college and I fully expect to end up in a dead-end job in a dying world. I have no hope or optimism for the future anymore. The state the world is in has completely crushed me. During the heatwave this week, I stayed in bed for days because I couldn't think about it. I don't like to go outside and I hate the sound of birds or the feeling of grass because I know those things will be taken away from me by the time I'm forty. I want to die. Sometimes, I just think of ways I could do it. If it weren't for my parents, I would. I'm an only child and maybe if I had a sibling, I would kill myself. But I'm all they have and it would break them if I killed themselves. I can't do that, but I want to die so badly it hurts. Today, I went into the bathroom and tried to find something sharp to cut myself with and cried because I couldn't. I can't enjoy anything anymore. Happiness just feels fake, and I can't enjoy anything without remembering that it won't last. The moments of happiness are the worst because if I think that maybe if I had born a decade or so earlier, I might have had a chance at being happy. My parents also make it so hard. They're so happy and optimistic, and I know that if I talk to them about it, they won't understand how helpless I feel. Sometimes, I want to talk to them but I know they can't protect me anymore. I want to die. I texted the suicide hotline yesterday and told them how I was feeling and they just repeated that ""it sounds like I'm worried about the future and my safety"" and then asked if I was going to kill myself because they wanted to make sure I was safe. How ironic. I told them know because I was worried they would find some way to figure out my identity. Then I'd probably end up in a mental facility medicated beyond oblivion. I don't understand why everyone feels the need to protect people from suicide. I think death would be better than living on this planet for almost eighty years, if we last that long. I almost wish that my family didn't love me so I could kill myself and just be done with it. I want to die. I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm miserable and I want out but I can't.

"Weaning off Effexor ER... worst pain of my entire life (Trigger warning: depression, suicide)","Hi all! I'm a 20 year old college student. I'm a female using she/her pronouns. I've been on Effexor XR for probably a little over a year. I have been weaning off Effexor for about 2 weeks now and this is the worst its been. I've been doing this with the help of my therapist and doctor to do it as safe as possible. I feel so depressed and alone. My mind keeps going to very dark places about life not being worth it. I feel completely alone and feels like this may never end. I want to cry about every six hours, it helps to have family on stand by. I cant hold a job right now because the nausea and brain zaps are horrible. They make me want to ball up and cry. I feel extremely depersonalized and as if I'm standing in front of a mirror but cant see who I am. The brain fog (zaps) are also getting so bad. I never thought the withdrawals would be so bad. Why did my doctor never warn me of this?? 

I started to wean off this medicine because of how bad the nausea and vomiting withdrawals are even if I miss one day of not taking them. Effexor made me feel super depersonalized and really out of it. I felt like I was in a senseless void. But, these withdrawals are making it so hard. I'm so scared of myself...

I started at 150 mg and now im on 37.5 mg almost every day. I've heard good things about Wellbutrin especially since I have ADHD (non-medicated), I'm just so scared of going through this again. I have never felt this sad and depressed in my entire life. Anxiety has consumed me whole within the last few days. The thought of going outside or even being social makes me want to cry and vomit at the same time.

I “overdosed” and blamed it on my doctor who gave me the prescription,"I took too many pills and was bleeding in the ER for 2 hours straight. 

I took three different drugs, one, being a blood thinner… The entire experience was so uncomfortable, I was bleeding from inside my mouth so I couldn’t speak and at one point I started choking on my own blood. 


Instead of owning up to what I did to myself, I decided to just lie and say it’s what I was prescribed for a minor surgery I got. 

I posted on snapchat about being in the hospital, I don’t exactly know why I did— I set up myself for humiliation cuz now I’m now dubbed “the girl who tried to kill herself.” It pisses me the fuck off because I didn’t even tell anyone about kms, they just assume so bc they know Im depressed. It hurts cuz it’s true.

Like I'm not allowed to be happy and it scares me from trying to enjoy life or make friends. I also wish someone could be there for me as I am there for them. I feel like a side character where I'm not important enough for anyone to give a damn. As for romance, I've given up falling for anyone. At this point I think I'm one of the few that doesn't deserve a happily ever after.

I don't know what to do.,"So I'm having a rough time lately and thought if I ended everything it would benefit everyone involved. I miss my Dad and want to see him (he passed in March), my boyfriend is losing patience with my depression. I can't seem to get the motivation to do anything than head to work and get something to eat. There's more, but I can't remember at the moment.

So I've never self-harmed before. I don't know what happened, or why, and I hoped it was a bad dream. I took an x-acto knife and started cutting.

I wanted to, but I also feel like I didn't. I was hoping to hit a decently sized vein, and that my blood was thin enough (I'd taken ibuprofen for a headache) to just kinda work. 

I missed the major veins. Part of it was likely on purpose. I think. 

So I'm panicking and don't know what to do. They're too obvious and chaotic to explain as something else. I haven't told anyone and am worried someone might notice. I have them covered with large bandaids and am changing them frequently and applying Neosporin hoping to avoid scarring. 

So, I guess. Where do I go from here? What if someone finds out? How do I hide them?

Existential crisis,I just went a solid 5 days without wanting to kill myself for the first time in a while. I don't think the state I'm in is classified as happiness though. In fact I don't think I have felt true happiness ever. Well happiness over an extended period of time I should say. Every somewhat high point is almost immediately ruined and its to the point that I get suspicious if everything goes good for a while. This then led to the realization that nothing I do truly matters and has never truly mattered. Does it stop the emotional turmoil I feel daily? Not really. Will it stop me from contributing to society so that my needs get met? Not really. Here I am realizing that nothing I do matters yet still I'm still doing it and still feeling shitty doing it.

Climbing out of the spiral of depression,"Depression is such a loose term that tries to encapsulate the different symptoms, behaviours and mindsets of those who struggle with it. The extent to which it might be debilitating differs from person to person. The cause of it might differ as well. 

Here's my version of it. I've been experiencing depression since I was 8. Looking back at what I had gone through as a child, my experiences shaped my mindset. Unfortunately, the experiences I had as a child were filled with abandonment, rejection, disappointment and breach of trust. There were also moments of realisation that acceptance could be achieved if I tried to be someone else. The playful and mischievous kid turned into a quiet, well-behaved, socially distant and awkward teenager in the hopes that his teachers would accept him. No friend gained though. Even my major was selected on the basis of ""what major would make my parents accept me?""

Isn't it weird that the very thing that you consciously try to avoid turns you into that very same monster? I made every attempt to not be like my Dad. Guess what? I'm so much like him. I tried so hard to be someone whom others would accept only to be rejected over and over. 

It got to a stage where I just gave up. ""Why bother?"" In my opinion, those are the two most dangerous words in the world. Thus began the downward spiral into the vortex of depression. A stage of depression where you become nonchalant about anyone and everything. You gradually lose the capacity to care. That's where I am right now as a 38 year old. Of course, with this conscious conditioning, it has a biochemical effect on your body to adapt to your new way of 'being'. This was when I met 'Anhedonia'. Supposedly a symptom of depression but I'm sure others would affirm that it is a monster of a different kind.

For those who had reached this level of debilitation, how did you get out of it?",Jazzlike-Dig9384,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oc2pmg/climbing_out_of_the_spiral_of_depression/,depression loose term try encapsulate different symptom behaviour mindset struggle extent might debilitating differs person person cause might differ well version experiencing depression since wa 8 looking back gone child experience shaped mindset unfortunately experience child filled abandonment rejection disappointment breach trust also moment realisation acceptance could achieved tried someone else playful mischievous kid turned quiet well behaved socially distant awkward teenager hope teacher would accept friend gained though even major wa selected basis major would make parent accept weird thing consciously try avoid turn monster made every attempt like dad guess much like tried hard someone others would accept rejected got stage gave bother opinion two dangerous word world thus began downward spiral vortex depression stage depression become nonchalant anyone everything gradually lose capacity care right 38 year old course conscious conditioning ha biochemical effect body adapt new way wa met anhedonia supposedly symptom depression sure others would affirm monster different kind reached level debilitation get,climbing spiral depression,1886,40

I don't know where else to turn.,"Hi everyone. I'd first like to thank you for taking the time to read this. It feels as though I've spiraled to the lowest point in my life. There's much I could say but I'll just bring up a few points.
I feel like an absolute waste of space. I've suffered loneliness and depression since middle school. When I first spoke to a counselor, she noticed some scars, so I was Baker acted at 13. My only memories of high school consist of quiet tears on the bus ride, sitting alone at lunch, and missing days because my anxiety grew unbearable. I've ruined my relationships. I possibly have BPD, but can't say for certain unless I get a professional diagnosis. I only had one or two friends growing up and I'm not entirely sure why they've stuck around. I nearly lost one of them because I felt like too much of a burden to keep in contact during a time I should have. Everyone I meet reminds me of how insufferable I am. I'm truly undesirable and unnoticeable. People forget I'm in the room. No one cares about what I have to say. When I build up the courage to speak, it's only followed by regret. I say all the wrong things and make a fool of myself if I talk and when I don't I'm too quiet/weird/boring. 
I've messed up every good thing in my life. When I try to make things better, I just end up in a worse position than before. I feel like I'm made up of poison. I'm constantly on the verge of tears. My coworkers either tolerate me or clearly dislike when I'm around. I try to stay out of their way yet I'm often yelled at or used as an emotional punching bag. I'm always under pressure to not make any mistake or they'll resent me even more. They have every right to honestly. I think everyone resents me once they get to know me. I wish I never existed. My parents deserved better than me. My partner could easily do better, the way he looks at me breaks my heart. I only see him genuinely happy and enjoying himself with anyone else. When it's just me and him, I always question why he's wasting his time. I think if he had a little more confidence, he'd realize he could have any girl he wanted. Someone he can truly bond with. Someone who will offer more than I could ever dream of. 
My heart has been aching for a long time. At the end of the day, there is nothing to love or remotely like about me. I've been terrible because of my distrust, insecurities, and anger. I detest myself. My lack of a personality combined with grotesque appearance and worthless soul. I don't know who I am anymore. I've only ever felt others' disgust towards me. That's all I've experienced to be true. I was Baker acted a second time when I relapsed and needed stitches. A few years down the line and here I am. I don't have many fun memories or can look back to a time when things were better. My sadness has weighed heavier each day for as long as I can remember. I live like a robot now. Days blend together. Work, sleep, school. Lay in bed on my days off. Cry at work, cry to sleep. I'm almost 25. I don't have a license. I've never looked forward to a weekend. I forget there's a world out there full of life and people who are always experiencing so much. I just waste away at home with no one and nowhere to go. The few times I've been to places with my partner, I just end up breaking down because I can't bear this sadness anymore. I can't escape this misery. I'm either in a state of panic with an aching pain in my chest, suffocating and nauseous from crying so much or I'm simply numb and hollow until my breaking point again. That's my life's cycle. It feels like I'm drowning and I just won't die.

Free but surrounded by nothing,"It feels like there’s no difference doing things and completely doing nothing so I don’t do anything..life’s just completely meaningless to me at this point. I feel maybe it’s always been this way and my pain came from desperately trying to cling onto things that ultimately I knew would never fulfill me.

How to battle low self-esteem?,"I've been battling depression, social anxietx, low-selfconfidence and pretty much non-existing self-esteem since I was a kid. While I've made certain steps and managed to improve my situation, I've basically not been able to really do anything about the self-esteem issue. 

A lot of the times I can ''not care'' about other people and their opinion, but once I try to open up and do something about my social anxiety, the realization how worthless I am hits me like a train. 

I don't know how to have friends because I'm a boring person who has very little in common with the ''normal'' people. I constantly feel like I have to put on a mask and a bad act to hide my worthlessness, but people quickly see through it, notice I'm 'strange'' and keep away from me which again fuels my view that I'm inadequate. It's a vicious circle. 

I would love to fit in, keep conversations, etc but I don't know how / majority of topics bore me. Plus when I talk, the others stop listening after one second or I just get talked over immediately. When I address the issue, people are just annoyed by my presence. 

I'm not autistic or anything the like. Just suffered from social isolation and consequently socially inept. 

I did meet few people that conversing with works, but those usually see my enthusiasm as a bad sign and stay away.
At the same time, if it did work, I get scared to become friends and then experience us losing the connection or me being even more unskilled next time. It pressures me and I tend to avoid it.

Friend needs help,"My mum’s friend (38F) (who is also my mum’s boyfriend’s brothers girlfriend) has definitely been showing signs of depression. According to my mum and her boyfriend she never leaves her bedroom, she is constantly avoiding her own boyfriend (moving to a different area of the house from him every time he sits with her), she’s randomly nasty at times and doesn’t want to do anything. Shes even been faking illness so she doesn’t have to come places. She talks on this chat room for grieving people since her dog died. All she does is talk to these depressed people online. All day, all night, at work, at home. Like she’s addicted to this chat room and it seems like all these people do is keep her in this depressive state (it’s the same ppl she talks to, she has friends on there). Also her dog died a year ago and she’s obsessively upset about it. She’s just as upset as the day he did died one year on and to me it just doesn’t make sense? Her dog was her baby but he was getting old and she’d always casually be mentioning “ah well when he dies we’ll-“ “well he’ll probably pop his clogs soon and then-“ but now he’s gone she cries every time he’s brought up. A year on. Every single conversation is about him as well. I’m not denying her grief but it’s very out of character for her and so unexpected. I’ve even heard that she’s been more upset about the dog dying than when her own mother died. idk. Either way she definitely needs help but none of us know how to go about this.

"Don't want to do anything, don't want to sleep it away, either.","It's tiring to be on my phone, too. I've been waking up and laying in bed in the morning lately, it is a trance, I don't have anything to do but to lay there.

I've nothing to do around the house, everything is clean. I went on my daily walk, but it worsened my mood. Won't eat, I.D.C. About the flavor, none of that matters anymore, I don't like the feeling. My considered O.K. Foods are lessening daily.

Sometimes it's so hard to just fucking turn on my computer and sit in front of it.

Why do I feel so disappointed every time I wake up and find myself breathing, having to force myself to live another fucking day in my world? Musashi Miyamoto says ""Don't regret your choices in life"" but no matter how much advice I listen to or take, how many books or podcasts I consume, I can't apply anything and I keep regretting being born every minute. Everything is so hard, I just want to give up before even trying it, and that makes me feel even shittier because I lose time and don't have anything valuable to my name because I can't get myself to do anything that requires even the most minimal amount of effort. All I want to do is browse the internet meaninglessly and stop breathing one day so I don't have to do anything ever again and can disappear in peace, not troubling anyone anymore. I fucking hate this feeling of anhedonia, I will gladly accept any other symptom of depression but this one is the fucking worst.

I cant get over the past I wish I could just fucking stop ruminating,"I know this is sloppy but bare with me:

I'm 14M and the past year 2020 for me especially april/may-february has been a clusterfuck and the worst part is after the whole thing not while it was happening. Ever since february (when I started severly ruminating about the year before)  all I could think of the whole day was what I haven't done last year and how much better everything would be if  last year I did what I fucking want to now. I'm not going to be publics about it, but last year I had one interest I would spend all day on. I was somewhat depressed because I had a lot of fights with my parents april and one involved the cops getting called and they came to my house, starting saying I need to change and be fixed (I didnt want to )and  I think that basically changed most of my life. After that my main interest it took over my life after that I didn't talk to my parents and I spent all the time in my room. It was covid as you probablyt know so I couldnt do anything. All the time I spent was alone in my room. But that's just some background info. Now the main thing is my rumination of what I could've done in May-august 2020 aka when it was before 8th grade school but I had all free time. The thing I liked then  was all I spent my time on. I'm just going to say it it was hip hop/rap music, thats all I cared about then but the thing is all I did was fucking argue about it on the youtube comments and dumb ass shit like that. Then in september school started and I stated to want to have more interests and passions but then for some reason I didnt I guess and stuck with it. I barely remember anything from september-december 2020 even though I remember stuff a whole year and more before that perfectly. In february I started being more interested in another interest/passion/hobby film/tv and then other types of music. Which is 2 hobbies a much wider variety. I also just wished I would had other interests hobbies. From feb-now that's all I could think of, how I wish my interests/hobbies were different when I had the time. There are moments, usually spanning a few days, where I think forward and more positive. But 98 percent of the time from feb-now all I can think of is how I wish I just went back to may or so 2020. I just fucking hate that I can never get that time back and I wasted it all on something I show a bit of interest I don't want to do at all. I look at other stories of depression and feel jealous that they had more than one inerest or had any interests at all.  I just can't fucking explain it. I know I have my whole life ahead of me but then fucking high school, is starting and I wish I could be happy for it but now all I want to do is skip freshman year and go next year or just pretend I'm 13 and that I'm turning 14 next year and forget everything about last year or pretend I was born a year after I was. I wish life was that way. I just typed the first things on my mind because I can't think straight for some reason. I hope at least one person would understand this paragraph though.  I cant fucking  cope with my constant interest changes too because I was always that type of person to switch main inteerests every 5 or so months but no obsession I had has been as severe as the one to what i liked in 2020 the worst moment the one I wish had changed. I like something different now and I wished that was what my obsession was, not what it actually was. Better yet I could've been a normal person and what I was before then and had more than 1 interests at once.  .Anyways I just need to stop ruminating about the fucking past it is driving me crazy thats all Ive been doing 24/7 for the past 5/6 months I cant take it. . Every singe thing I see reminds me of it and I cant fucking take it.Therapy doesnt work all thereapists/psychologists mock me for thinking about the past and say that it isnt that bad just fuck you how did you get hired all they do is tell me to stay in school even though the shool system is fuking shit and for what I want to be when I grow up 1/50th of what they teach in school matters for it. 

The reason my writing was so sloppy is because everyone I tell the story to they all mock me and say that my life is ahead of me and I should stop worrying and just instead of thinking about he past do those things now even though I fucking hate how I fucked up time and my life.

I can tthink straight or tell this story straight I told it the most straightforward way I could and it still is a mindfuck comprehending what I can say. I just have so much on my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this is 10 minutes after I wrote this I can think straight moreso. For some reason the main problem of this I cannot quite decipher in my mind in words. I know what it is, but I can't. I dont blame you if you don't understand my main problem in my paragraph, but I do have one. Id also rather have people say what my problem is then tell me just how to get over the past (most other people I see that have trobule getting over the past have a completely different problem of it than I do This is a throwway for obvious reasons since it would be an embarrasment to my main account that I put this on there.",InternationalStyle16,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oc4ekc/i_cant_get_over_the_past_i_wish_i_could_just/,know sloppy bare 14m past year 2020 especially april may february ha clusterfuck worst part whole thing wa happening ever since february started severly ruminating year could think whole day wa done last year much better everything would last year fucking want going public last year one interest would spend day wa somewhat depressed lot fight parent april one involved cop getting called came house starting saying need change fixed didnt want think basically changed life main interest took life talk parent spent time room wa covid probablyt know couldnt anything time spent wa alone room background info main thing rumination could done may august 2020 aka wa 8th grade school free time thing liked wa spent time going say wa hip hop rap music thats cared thing wa fucking argue youtube comment dumb shit like september school started stated want interest passion reason didnt guess stuck barely remember anything september december 2020 even though remember stuff whole year perfectly february started interested another interest passion hobby film tv type music 2 hobby much wider variety also wished would interest hobby feb could think wish interest hobby different time moment usually spanning day think forward positive 98 percent time feb think wish went back may 2020 fucking hate never get time back wasted something show bit interest want look story depression feel jealous one inerest interest fucking explain know whole life ahead fucking high school starting wish could happy want skip freshman year go next year pretend 13 turning 14 next year forget everything last year pretend wa born year wa wish life wa way typed first thing mind think straight reason hope least one person would understand paragraph though cant fucking cope constant interest change wa always type person switch main inteerests every 5 month obsession ha severe one liked 2020 worst moment one wish changed like something different wished wa obsession wa actually wa better yet could normal person wa 1 interest anyways need stop ruminating fucking past driving crazy thats ive 24 7 past 5 6 month cant take every singe thing see reminds cant fucking take therapy doesnt work thereapists psychologist mock thinking past say isnt bad fuck get hired tell stay school even though shool system fuking shit want grow 1 50th teach school matter reason writing wa sloppy everyone tell story mock say life ahead stop worrying instead thinking past thing even though fucking hate fucked time life tthink straight tell story straight told straightforward way could still mindfuck comprehending say much mind amp x200b 10 minute wrote think straight moreso reason main problem cannot quite decipher mind word know dont blame understand main problem paragraph one id also rather people say problem tell get past people see trobule getting past completely different problem throwway obvious reason since would embarrasment main account put,cant get past wish could fucking stop ruminating,5177,68
How depression ruined my life more then everything making me depressed,"I have always been a bit overweight for my age group but three years ago is when I had my first long episode of depression and it went on for almost 2 months and I couldn’t find a way to effectively cope. Once the episode ended I realized I needed a way to suppress it the best I could so I looked for things that may help and up comes eating. I’ve never really eaten healthy but it’s the one thing that can nearly always take something off of my mind, little did I know that this would be the worst way to cope even put against cutting. When I started getting depressed I was around 160lbs which for my age and height is way over what it should be for a healthy teen and if you want to know why my way of coping is so bad, I’m now 254 lbs as of this morning and I’m not allowed to go outside without a proper reason and supervision because I’m supposedly less qualified to take a fight than Laurie from the nail salon living with my parents and all as well as not being able to drive yet, and I’ve gained almost 100 lbs in the years of my depression and now not only am I insecure about my body but I also have the health problems that come with being way to far on the obese scale but I still don’t have another way to cope and I’m lost on what to do",me2136,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/obysca/how_depression_ruined_my_life_more_then/,always bit overweight age group three year ago first long episode depression went almost 2 month find way effectively cope episode ended realized needed way suppress best could looked thing may help come eating never really eaten healthy one thing nearly always take something mind little know would worst way cope even put cutting started getting depressed wa around 160lbs age height way healthy teen want know way coping bad 254 lb morning allowed go outside without proper reason supervision supposedly le qualified take fight laurie nail salon living parent well able drive yet gained almost 100 lb year depression insecure body also health problem come way far obese scale still another way cope lost,depression ruined life everything making depressed,1252,70
I just regret not doing it now,"I’ve been feeling down to be honest, then again that’s nothing new.

You know when people tell you “just suck it up, it’s going to get better”, or at least something like that.

Yeah, that was me about seven months ago when I was trying to decide on wether or not to just end everything on my eighteenth birthday. 

Clearly, I’ve decided to stick around to see what could happen, maybe things would get better? 

Yk hope for the best… but it’s only gotten worse.

Funny to be honest, at least for me, I believed that if I just gave everyone a chance again, everything would get better. But it hasn’t, some people “changed” but they’re still the same.

My mother still treats me like something she needs to fix. My brother doesn’t even respect me as a person half the time. My father sees me as a burden and apparently my stepmother is jealous of me. 

I can only imagine what would’ve happened if I had gone through with it that night. 

Would they have been devastated like they claim? Or just blame me… like they always have. 

I’ve told my family about my self diagnosed depression. And I guess it is all in my head. Like my mother said “it’s only for attention.”

And yeah, I really should’ve just gone ahead and said my goodbyes that night. If only I could die with no regrets, but I’m not that lucky.

To be honest I was an optimist for the first time in over a decade that night. A part of me lying my to myself to keep me alive and the other part telling me the reality of things, the unfiltered truth I always denied existed.

I should’ve listened to my realty… no one ever truly changes. Especially the ones you want to the most.

I’m not even sure why I write this for strangers to read.

Actually no, I do know.

Because at least here on the internet, no one can laugh in my face and call me a liar. 

So to whoever read this far, thanks, I really appreciate it and I hope you have a great day or night :)

I couldn't even kill myself properly..,"I got scared. I got scared of all the things I would be missing out. There's still so much I wanted to do, all my life I've tried so hard to do something with my life. No matter how hard I try, it's never enough, I can't even hold the fruits of my labour and appreciate its beauty. How many more times will I be given a glimpse of everything I desire, everything I possibly can't have, a glimmer of how better life could be, and then snatched away before I can get close. I see all the opportunities I can never have, the person I can never be, because of the country I'm born in and the colour of my skin. I'm tired, so tired. I'm at a point way beyond my limit, how many more breakdowns, how many more broken pieces, how many more scars, how many more panic attacks, how much longer should I stare at the void. My whole life has been this way ever since I can remember. I can't go on much longer... But apparently even in my last moments, I fail to do it right, I let myself get help and get admitted in the hospital to pump out all the drugs. Why did I still hope that life could be better when I've only known otherwise?

It's bad enough that my mind betrayed me (whichever choice you choose to be the betrayal feel free to decide), I have to constantly answer everyone's questions of why and listen to their judgements, scoldings and condemnation. I even have to explain to the police why I did it. I DON'T KNOW WHY I DID IT, MAYBE I DON'T WANT TO LIVE ANYMORE, IF I KNEW EXACTLY WHY I CAN'T FIND THE STRENGTH TO LIVE, THEN I WOULDN'T BE HERE LISTENING TO YOUR BS!!!

DAY 1,"Ok.  I am posting here to have a little bit of accountability because I feel like I might need it this month.

I had a really disappointing meeting with my psychiatrist yesterday.  This was our first time meeting in about three months and since we met last, I continued taking my antidepressant but stopped my mood stabilizer.  She was really pissed at me and was being extremely discouraging right off the bat without even asking me my reasoning behind doing so.  Now she wants to put me on another mood stabilizer *sigh*  

I had been on Latuda since I first met with my psychiatrist last September when I suspected I was having a very rare manic episode (I had never been diagnosed bipolar before, but after working in mental health for 15 years and giving it much thought, I decided to address THAT while also finally getting some help for depression that I have been battling here and there unmedicated since I was a teenager).  My doctor put me only on the Latuda saying that it will help stabilize me while also helping with any bipolar depression that pops up.  Welllll the Latuda wasn't cutting it with the depression that sure did show up, and in January while I was more depressed than I could ever remember, I was put on Wellbutrin.  After the combination and feeling only slightly better but still pretty flat, I decided to stop the Latuda to see if maybe it was bringing the antidepressant down.  Coming off of the Latuda was a BITCH.  I had so much anxiety that I NEVER had before, but with my therapist and some time, I made it through to the other side.  I honestly don't feel any differently without it since I stopped in April.

My psychiatrist was trying to tell me that I was feeling better on the combination but I stressed to her that I WAS feeling better than I had in January (my very lowest point!).  Anything would have been an improvement!  She said that I never gave the combination a fair try and that I am not doing enough on my end to help my meds do their job.

Even though I don't like that she was snippy with me about the meds, I know that she is right that I am not always holding up my end of the bargain.  I still drink.  I still smoke weed.  I still don't have the motivation to seek out ways to improve-- exercising, meeting up and connecting with friends and family, etc.  She stressed to me that the meds aren't going to make me just go out and do these things-- they are there to HELP.  I'm a psych nurse, I get it.

Today, I am home from a week vacation where I didn't do myself ANY favors with the drinking and weed smoking.  I haven't done either today since I spent the whole day driving home so I think that I will make this my DAY 1 of trying to stay good.  I would like to see what a month of being good will do for me.  I definitely need to not drink and smoke.  It's going to be SO HARD since my partner also smokes and drinks, but he is supportive and wouldn't make it unnecessarily difficult for me or anything.  I also would like to factor in exercise and keeping in contact with friends/family. 

I'm just tired of feeling like I'm not getting anywhere.  I thought that with meds, managing my depression would be easier! Between meds and therapy, it's been a really rough time.  Anyway, I just thought I would post here to see if anyone has had luck trying to do something like this and how it ended up working out for you.  Maybe I'll post some progress entries along the way.",thots_n_prayers,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/obwlql/day_1/,ok posting little bit accountability feel like might need month really disappointing meeting psychiatrist yesterday wa first time meeting three month since met last continued taking antidepressant stopped mood stabilizer wa really pissed wa extremely discouraging right bat without even asking reasoning behind want put another mood stabilizer sigh latuda since first met psychiatrist last september suspected wa rare manic episode never diagnosed bipolar working mental health 15 year giving much thought decided address also finally getting help depression battling unmedicated since wa teenager doctor put latuda saying help stabilize also helping bipolar depression pop welllll latuda cutting depression sure show january wa depressed could ever remember wa put wellbutrin combination feeling slightly better still pretty flat decided stop latuda see maybe wa bringing antidepressant coming latuda wa bitch much anxiety never therapist time made side honestly feel differently without since stopped april psychiatrist wa trying tell wa feeling better combination stressed wa feeling better january lowest point anything would improvement said never gave combination fair try enough end help med job even though like wa snippy med know right always holding end bargain still drink still smoke weed still motivation seek way improve exercising meeting connecting friend family etc stressed med going make go thing help psych nurse get today home week vacation favor drinking weed smoking done either today since spent whole day driving home think make day 1 trying stay good would like see month good definitely need drink smoke going hard since partner also smoke drink supportive make unnecessarily difficult anything also would like factor exercise keeping contact friend family tired feeling like getting anywhere thought med managing depression would easier med therapy really rough time anyway thought would post see anyone ha luck trying something like ended working maybe post progress entry along way,day 1,3434,5

I don’t feel anything anymore. Everyday is just a day just to get over with.  I have nothing to look forward anymore. I have a dead bedroom issues. Getting fucked while not feeling anything. My husband never validate my feelings. Instead he turned it on me whenever I want to talk about what’s bothering me. I feel more alone than ever. I smoke from half a pack to one pack a day. Might even progress to two packs per day .. I’m struggling with tears... to even type this cause I don’t think anyone would understand me. 

Covid situation doesn’t even help .

My meals went from 3 meals a day to 1 meal or nothing.

Venting and Seeking Help,"I don't know how to move forward in this world. I know none of you are my therapist, but if you're willing to listen please grant me that. I never had a therapist, nor friends who would care, bar one but they're dealing with their own troubles and have no time for mine.

I turned 22 a little over a month ago and I haven't done a damn thing. I missed out on my formulative years cause I was too busy playing games, watching videos, and panicking whenever I was around people. It was seriously the most pathetic thing. Thing is, I wanted desperately to talk with my classmates and put myself out there. I wanted to be confident, and I never hated a single person around me. Only myself. I was lightly bullied by a lot of people who targeted me for seemingly no reason, other than that I was weak and an easy target.

There's a few instances I still remember, such as when one of my classmates told me ""nobody wants you here"" out on the basketball court during gym class, in front of everybody, and nobody said a thing. Even the teacher ignored it. I stood there, wandering back and forth for about a minute trying to get any kind of attention, but nobody said a thing. I walked back towards the school building, which was a good eigth mile away, visible right from the court. I walked slowly and nobody, not even the teacher stopped me or said anything. That was the first time I felt that alone, that was 7th grade. That year, little stuff happened all the time, but my mind's repressed most of it. I remember though, one time on the bus back home, a bunch of kids were calling out to me from the back. I wish I responded, they went on for a while. I was too scared.

I looked back at all these types of events last week, and I discovered it happened usually once a year with a different person. I'm not one to hold onto that shit, so I forgave them all, especially since it never got too serious, which I'm thankful for. However, I think the mental toll has been paid, and I'm pretty fucked cause of it.

A life of failure and disappointment later, me abandoning people I loved to talk to, me cutting ties, me being lazy and not taking action when I need to, all led to me being here now. A 22 year old nobody, no direction, nobody who will give me an objective, straight answer, no relationship experience, no money, nothing to show and already feeling like I'm in the shoes of a geezer.

I still have my dreams though, so many dreams. Like most other people, I would give so much just for a chance to go back and do it again, but who says it wouldn't just end up the same way? Two of my biggest insecurities were my *name* of all things, and my appearance. I was an ugly kid, a little better off now but not by much. So, realistically, my only choice is to carve forward. Still, I can't talk to people despite trying so, so hard, I have no confidence in myself whatsoever. Seriously, I don't know if it's the mild porn addiction, the lack of support or successes or whatever, but my confidence is through the damn floor. I know I'm self aware in most things, though I'm sure I got a million blind spots too, but the things I see are torturing me endlessly.

I want so many things in life. I want to move to San Francisco, finish off my (planned) last two years of college there, try to put myself out there one last time. I want to spend nights with a small group of friends by the beach and dock, in the city just enjoying life. I want to learn to skateboard. I want to learn Jiu Jitsu to gain some confidence, and to be able to protect myself and others, at least a little. I want to learn to make comics or manga or anything of the sort, and put what I have in mind into reality. I want to further my programming and finish my game I've been working on for the past year. I want to start a YouTube channel so I'd always have people to talk to who were interested in the same stuff as me, so I'd have an outlet to just talk. I want to be more confident. I want to be unreasonably confident. I want to put myself out there every chance I see a positive outcome from, even if it's a gamble. I want to be kind to everybody, regardless of my political beliefs. I want to help people just cause. I want to live an adventurous life. I want to fall in love. I want to start a family, raise 4+ happy kids in San Fran, send them to school and teach them to be strong and wise, and to enjoy their lives.

I'm currently stuck in my mom's house in suburbia, 8k in debt and running my days out as a wagie. I already feel so old. I don't know what to do. I can't hold most conversations. I'm a coward. Everybody's moving ahead in life, except for me.

My mom died a year ago and I feel so alone,"My mom died suddenly a year ago from cancer. This past year has been so hard. I miss her so much. She was the one person who I could talk to about anything. We lived a thousand miles away from each other, but she would answer the phone no matter what time it was. She always had time to get me through my anxiety attacks. I feel like others think I'm crazy when I fall into a panic, and she was the only one who knew how bad they really get because she got them too. She never judged me. We got each other through. Now that she's gone I realize that I have almost no friends and the ones I do have I can't talk to about what I feel inside because I'm afraid they will think I'm really loosing it. 

This past year I've fallen into a deep dark depression. The grief comes and goes. The anxiety is worse than ever.  The panic and paranoia are so real. And I realize I have no one to talk to about it. My husband of 8 years does his best to help me, but my internal struggles have really worn us down. Sometimes I'm so depressed that I can't feel anything.

I don't know why I'm avoiding therapy and why I'm avoiding any help at all...,"It's such a struggle. It **really is** as if I just have another force or something controlling me, keeping me from reaching out, calling for help, holding me down while the noises and thoughts grow too loud for me to even attempt to shout in the hopes of anyone hearing me...

I have to call my mental health specialist. But I am afraid to. I am angry and hurt and know that it isn't me that matters, but money. And I sort of understand that. I make very little, but I find money to be my savior for the week, because it means I get to eat...

But I'm getting sicker. In my head. I've not had a single therapy session for a couple months now. But when I was having weekly sessions...I wasn't talking about my thoughts. I was distracting my therapist. I was tricking him with good things I recall from the year, and in the past. I was lying by saying I am thankful and healthy. I'm worse than I think. I'm worse than I said. 

I want to call him and say I can't come back to our sessions. I don't matter, but I hope he got paid. I know it's his job to help, but I am just...difficult. I can't even handle me. I can't be honest in front of others...I can't open up in front of others....I can't be vulnerable. I just can't. It's too dangerous...

I'm on the edge. I'm honestly wishing for death to find me, so I won't have to face the world. So I won't have to feel pain anymore. So I won't have to go to work again. So I won't have to keep struggling and crying. So I don't have to worry more than I constantly do. So I can justify my lack of friends, my lack of dreams, my lack of self-discipline and hope. I'm in a very dark place...a very dark place...

I'll give him a call...leave him a message if possible...

I found out that the first person I fell in love with has still been legally married since the day I met him. I met him in January 2019 and he had told me he left his wife. I didn't really understand at the time because he was so vulnerable and open. He told me bits and pieces about their marriage and kept me on my toes. I wanted so badly to believe him. I trusted him but he only told me the truth recently about how he is still not divorced. He is separated yet not divorced. He is the only man that has ever looked at me with such admiration and love. He was the first man to tell me he loves me. Knowing this information after a shit year of losing friends has made me really doubt that anyone will actually be consistent in my life. He moved from my city back in June 2019 but I can't stop thinking about him. I feel crazy for the way that I feel. He's made so many poor choices and has had a poor choice of words.

Need advice,"New to this and hope you all can help. Thanks in advance. I recently started therapy for anxiety surrounding a medical issue I have had for a few years. During therapy I seem to have uncovered some potentially longstanding depression (predating the anxiety). In my last session my therapist recommended I see a psychiatrist and told me they think I'm depressed. This was 3 days ago. I'm supposed to leave for a weeklong trip with my girlfriend and her family in a few days. I was already dreading the trip because of my anxiety and the physical discomfort I will have for the duration of the trip, but now because I have been in this depressive episode and don't know how to deal with it, I have absolutely no desire to go, and no idea what to do about it.

Venting and Seeking Help,"I don't know how to move forward in this world. I know none of you are my therapist, but if you're willing to listen please grant me that. I never had a therapist, nor friends who would care, bar one but they're dealing with their own troubles and have no time for mine.

I turned 22 a little over a month ago and I haven't done a damn thing. I missed out on my formulative years cause I was too busy playing games, watching videos, and panicking whenever I was around people. It was seriously the most pathetic thing. Thing is, I wanted desperately to talk with my classmates and put myself out there. I wanted to be confident, and I never hated a single person around me. Only myself. I was lightly bullied by a lot of people who targeted me for seemingly no reason, other than that I was weak and an easy target.

There's a few instances I still remember, such as when one of my classmates told me ""nobody wants you here"" out on the basketball court during gym class, in front of everybody, and nobody said a thing. Even the teacher ignored it. I stood there, wandering back and forth for about a minute trying to get any kind of attention, but nobody said a thing. I walked back towards the school building, which was a good eigth mile away, visible right from the court. I walked slowly and nobody, not even the teacher stopped me or said anything. That was the first time I felt that alone, that was 7th grade. That year, little stuff happened all the time, but my mind's repressed most of it. I remember though, one time on the bus back home, a bunch of kids were calling out to me from the back. I wish I responded, they went on for a while. I was too scared.

I looked back at all these types of events last week, and I discovered it happened usually once a year with a different person. I'm not one to hold onto that shit, so I forgave them all, especially since it never got too serious, which I'm thankful for. However, I think the mental toll has been paid, and I'm pretty fucked cause of it.

A life of failure and disappointment later, me abandoning people I loved to talk to, me cutting ties, me being lazy and not taking action when I need to, all led to me being here now. A 22 year old nobody, no direction, nobody who will give me an objective, straight answer, no relationship experience, no money, nothing to show and already feeling like I'm in the shoes of a geezer.

I still have my dreams though, so many dreams. Like most other people, I would give so much just for a chance to go back and do it again, but who says it wouldn't just end up the same way? Two of my biggest insecurities were my *name* of all things, and my appearance. I was an ugly kid, a little better off now but not by much. So, realistically, my only choice is to carve forward. Still, I can't talk to people despite trying so, so hard, I have no confidence in myself whatsoever. Seriously, I don't know if it's the mild porn addiction, the lack of support or successes or whatever, but my confidence is through the damn floor. I know I'm self aware in most things, though I'm sure I got a million blind spots too, but the things I see are torturing me endlessly.

I want so many things in life. I want to move to San Francisco, finish off my (planned) last two years of college there, try to put myself out there one last time. I want to spend nights with a small group of friends by the beach and dock, in the city just enjoying life. I want to learn to skateboard. I want to learn Jiu Jitsu to gain some confidence, and to be able to protect myself and others, at least a little. I want to learn to make comics or manga or anything of the sort, and put what I have in mind into reality. I want to further my programming and finish my game I've been working on for the past year. I want to start a YouTube channel so I'd always have people to talk to who were interested in the same stuff as me, so I'd have an outlet to just talk. I want to be more confident. I want to be unreasonably confident. I want to put myself out there every chance I see a positive outcome from, even if it's a gamble. I want to be kind to everybody, regardless of my political beliefs. I want to help people just cause. I want to live an adventurous life. I want to fall in love. I want to start a family, raise 4+ happy kids in San Fran, send them to school and teach them to be strong and wise, and to enjoy their lives.

I'm currently stuck in my mom's house in suburbia, 8k in debt and running my days out as a wagie. I already feel so old. I don't know what to do. I can't hold most conversations. I'm a coward. Everybody's moving ahead in life, except for me.

"So my suicide plan is fucked(long text, but plz advice)","I was supposed to wait till summer vacation and buy a nitrogen tank and die without pain in my comfy bed, but i fucked up my test and now i think if my parents find out my grade, they're gonna take my phone away and put me on house arrest(although I'm pretty much already house arrested). it's gonna ruin my plan to order my nitrogen through my friends(i planned on telling em i need it to refill my bicycle tire or try nitro coffee). so now my options are:
A) be a runaway. I live in south korea, and it's not a really big city where i live. and the shelters ask kids to fill in forms and then they call the parents right away, so i have nowhere to sleep.
B) fall to death. not a pretty way to die, and i really hate pain. there's a reason i want to die by nitrogen.
C) fall, but on top of a car, so I have a chance to live. since my apartment is on the 6th floor, i could try to aim my fall. and if i survive, maybe my parents will finally realise i have a problem, and they have a problem too. but chances are I'll just fuck up and die, or suffer a fate even worse than death, or maybe my parents are even more evil than i expected and they won't care.
 Now, you may think this is too much a fuss for a exam grade, but in south korea exam grades are everything. my parents always said they (don't care) about my grades, but i was always a smart person, and i got all A's but i got into high school now, and i fucked the last exam(my first exam in high school) and they were pissed. now i fucked up even more, and now my life is in danger of being even more dark and painful.

How do I get over graduating college much later than everyone I went to school with?,"I dropped out of college my freshman year due to suicidal depression. I took a break from school for 2 years after that and am just now able to do well in my classes.

I made honor roll all my years in grade school because I wanted to be successful. I wanted success so bad. If I were to continue college, I’d be graduating 2-3 years after my peers and I still don’t know what I want to major in. 

A lot of times I hate myself because what do you do when it’s your own mind that has caused so much damage in your life? It feels like my own mind has failed me. Can’t trust it to make decisions or just be normal. It’s hard to be easy on myself when depression isn’t some physical illness people can see.

"I need some sort of love in my life, because this is just debilitating.","There for the longest time, I was content with having nobody. I knew seeking love from my family was a lost cause since my mom was (and still is) less than approving of me, and my dad's working all the fucking time. I've always been extremely socially anxious courtesy of Asperger’s, and confronting anyone at school was never an option I considered. I was happy alone, since anything was better than that debilitating anxiety I was cursed with facing. But after fifteen years of having nobody, I'm really reconsidering.

Every day is the same now. Wake up wishing I had someone to tell good morning, get ready of the day wishing I had someone to be ready for, go do what the fuck ever (mow lawns for cash, practice keyboard, study music, or other shit) wishing I had someone to share my day with, get ready for bed wishing I had someone to tell me about their day and reassure me that I did enough, and combat chronic insomnia wanting to have had someone tell me goodnight. There is no true variation in the days my life consists of. Hell, even calling it a life is a stretch, because ultimately, I'm not living. I do not feel alive.

I tried confronting people at school. I really did. I tried to converse with people I'd once known to be the fuel to my grand, nightmarish, day-to-day struggle. The result was ridiculing. In the eyes of my peers, my personality is my academics. That was my sacrifice in skipping two grades. I'm still slandered for being autistic, which is something I could've avoided hadn't I have been open about it. It's for things like this that I believe I'd have someone that enjoyed my presence for me weren't I to be myself. What a settling thought that is.

I've never been hugged. Only two people have ever told me that that they are proud of me, one of which has since passed away, and the other abandoned me mere days ago. I met the latter here on Reddit in another account. We actually got along well, I loved talking to her, and I thought she loved talking to me. I was convinced that I was ready to trust someone. Then she up and fucking disappeared, proving to be just as absent as everyone else that ""cared"". As a matter of fact, said abandonment is why I'm here right now. I presented my heart to someone, and she branded it. It genuinely burned.

I don't know how I'd react to praise. I don't know how I'd react to care. I don't know how I'd react to love. Why? Because I've never been able to look one in the eyes and tell it ""I know how you feel"". I want to feel, finally. I've been told to be dismissive of this idea before, but I don't care if I'm ""just a hormonal, confused teenage boy"". I'm a person, too. I can tire and be saddened like everyone else. Like I am today. I want nothing more than someone to love and be there for.",a__lonely__child,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/oc0t81/i_need_some_sort_of_love_in_my_life_because_this/,longest time wa content nobody knew seeking love family wa lost cause since mom wa still le approving dad working fucking time always extremely socially anxious courtesy asperger confronting anyone school wa never option considered wa happy alone since anything wa better debilitating anxiety wa cursed facing fifteen year nobody really reconsidering every day wake wishing someone tell good morning get ready day wishing someone ready go fuck ever mow lawn cash practice keyboard study music shit wishing someone share day get ready bed wishing someone tell day reassure enough combat chronic insomnia wanting someone tell goodnight true variation day life consists hell even calling life stretch ultimately living feel alive tried confronting people school really tried converse people known fuel grand nightmarish day day struggle result wa ridiculing eye peer personality academic wa sacrifice skipping two grade still slandered autistic something could avoided open thing like believe someone enjoyed presence settling thought never hugged two people ever told proud one ha since passed away abandoned mere day ago met latter reddit another account actually got along well loved talking thought loved talking wa convinced wa ready trust someone fucking disappeared proving absent everyone else cared matter fact said abandonment right presented heart someone branded genuinely burned know react praise know react care know react love never able look one eye tell know feel want feel finally told dismissive idea care hormonal confused teenage boy person tire saddened like everyone else like today want nothing someone love,need sort love life debilitating,2773,71
"I'm not diagnosed, but for years I've felt behind all my peers, I'm like a zombie or a robot only doing the bare necessities. I have no drive or motivation for anything","I'm fairly certain that this is what depression feels like. I've never had dreams or life goals and I deal with constant apathy about what happens to me.
I graduated high school last year during covid and went to university, but after 2 months I basically gave up. I felt overwhelmed and like what I was doing wasnt the right thing for me. But I've felt this way for 7 to 8 years.

All my life I've only done the bare minimum to look and behave socially acceptable. As soon as I'm by myself I abandon all attempts to care for my body and environment.
Watching all my friends succeed in their studies probably hurts the most. I know my brain is capable of studying and university, I don't feel stupid. But I feel so completely and utterly useless and incapable. It feels like ""life"" and me don't work together. I don't see a future for myself. And worse, I've rejected all help from family so far and isolate myself more every month.

I don't want to see a doctor or psychiatrist, I have in the past and all their plans to help me get a routine failed because I wasn't ready to stick to it.

I need to make decisions soon, I need to go back to university, or work, or anything else. But right now in this moment, I can't even get up to have more than one meal a day.

You ever think about how emotions are a net negative on life?,"If you weight each emotion on a scale from -10 - +10 on how good they make you feel then find your average ranking through life Im almost positive for most of us, I know it’s that way for me at least, it’s probably negative number?

I hate it here // TW: suicidal thoughts,"Ever since my depression started I have hated myself more than any other thing in this world. I hate it here. 
I'm constantly day dreaming and lost in fictional realities because I can't stand the idea that THIS is my life. THIS is who I unfortunately am. 
And I feel so guilty knowing that many people have worse situations and could be happy with what I have. But can't stop the feeling of wanting to disappear. To die. 
I don't wanna be me. Why can't I be somebody else? Why can't someone else who deserves the chance have MY life? Someone who is going to take advantage of it. I know I'm gonna die miserably. I'm gonna work my ass off 9-5 in a shitty system where I can't follow my dreams. I'm gonna die alone due to my ugliness and depression. 
I know, this is pathetic and melodramatic. I scold myself for that. But this is how I feel. This is how I wake up everyday. Just wanting to disappear. 
I want to be happy. I don't wanna hate myself. But with the standard that society has it's impossible to think I will actually be happy. I'm not pretty. I'm not skinny. I'm not smart. I'm not talented. I am just an average person who is going to die alone. That scares the shit out of me. My inner child screams at me for letting this happen. I could fight. But what for? We are nothing. Our existence is literally insignificant for the universe and others. If nobody knows me then I never existed.

love is when you are at 3 am crying like a fucking baby on the floor cause she broke up with you 

love is when you go to school with that feeling you worth nothing without her.

love is the feeling of waking up in the morning and all you think is about her.

"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement","We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

Please remember that NO ACTIVISM of any kind is allowed here. Not today or any day.,"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide *is*, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times.  

Please understand that we're all for well-informed, strategically-savvy activism.  It's essential in the fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and the fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding.  Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL.  

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population.  We used to allow it, until the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming, and, not without regret, we made this rule.  Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our members' wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

Is it to pay bills, with money I don't have, from jobs I can't keep? Is it to be alone forever, each day growing further apart from my friends &amp; family? Is it watching my family grow older and older and dying and having to take care of them? Is it working for any reason and having your savings stolen by your parent? Is it living with repressed childhood trauma and untreated ADHD for my entire life? Is it constantly getting my hopes up about a job or college and then quitting after one week? Is it laying in bed wanting to just sleep until I'm dead?

Jesus H fucking Christ. No good comes from my being alive. It's JUST suffering. Never any happiness, never any success, never any connections with anyone, never any sympathy or accomodations for living with multiple disabilities, nothing.

Anyone who says I ought to deal with any one of these things, and not just off myself over it, is a fucking moron who gets off on the idea of ""saving lives."" It's really disgusting to me.

But nope, the fear is still very much there. It makes me feel so trapped, like I have no option but to do something that I don't want to - either live in misery or stop existing altogether.

I was put in a psych ward back in October. For a google search.,"Title sound a little confusing? Yeah. That’s what I felt like the whole ordeal. 

In October of 2020, on the 12th, I was in the middle of online class. Honors English, at 10:15 AM, we were reading 1984. My mother sat down next to me, and said unto me:

“So, I’ve just gotten an email from the school.”

“Okay..?”

“It says you googled something relating to suicide.”

“I might’ve.” 

“Do you want to go to the hospital?”

“Not really. I’m in the middle of English.”

“Wasn’t a question.”

We got in the car, and drove to the hospital. I was entered in and they gave me a room at the back of the building. I couldn’t leave it, I didn’t have my phone with me to talk to anyone aside from whichever poor nurse was out there, and I was there until Thursday. Throughout the week my parents visited, and every day after that Monday I constantly asked “When can I leave? I want to go home, I’m feeling much better now.” 

They sent me up on Thursday evening, and hyped me up for it from Tuesday to Wednesday. Like it was fucking Disneyworld. I got into an ambulance, they laid me out on the gurney, and we took the 2 hour boat trip to the mainland. We drove a little to a seemingly nice little place called Pembroke Hospital. I saw it through the little door windows, and assumed I would be there for maybe a day or two. That was the agreement. Give it a try for a day, and we’ll bring you up to Rhode Island, a place I loved and where we were supposed to go anyway. So when we got inside, I noticed the peeling paint and rather unusual smell. Like a rotted food of some kind. They gave me my room (read that as ‘cell’ because it was a room with one barred window, a brick of a bed, and a desk) and the hours passed, and I eventually fell asleep. Friday came, met some of the other poor inmates, and called my mom. During said call a fucking fight broke out. Someone did a fucking Wolverine off the table and dove right onto the other person. I asked when I could leave, and my mother said to ask the doctor. There wasn’t really one, it was predominantly nurses. They gave me a sheet that basically said “You’re here til the doctor says otherwise. Weekends don’t count, chuckles. Enjoy prison.” 

On Sunday I finally saw a doctor, and let loose everything I felt. Funny enough, the doctor learned I felt worse in here than I did at home, or school. Fights every day, the fact I wasn’t allowed sweatpants or sweatshirts so I had to wear shorts and a short sleeved shirt in a New England fall, everything. Here’s a paraphrased transcription. 

“How are you?”

“Worse in here, now let me out.”

“What’s your experience been like in here?”

“Constant fights, mindless elementary school-grade paperwork, and prison food and rooms.”

“Alright. I’ll see what I can do.”

He discharged me Monday. I was picked up at 5 PM, by my mother and uncle, and ate like a starved homeless man a few bags of cheez its and Oreos. When we reached Rhode Island, I finished an entire pizza in 5 or 6 minutes. We saw a regular doctor a day later, and learned I had actually lost weight during my stay. I googled the place at my uncle’s (what used to be my granny’s house, god rest her soul) and learned it was barely cracking 2 stars.

Crying while writing.,"Me and my long term partner(4 years) broke up a few months ago, and since then it has been a real struggle trying to get myself back to ‘normal’ even though it is primarily my fault it ended as I kicked her out of my house. I regret it deeply. I should of taken the time to calm down and talk to her rather then just shoving her away but its to late now. I forgot how important she was to me staying mentally connected to this world and with her gone I feel no need to continue. 

The worst part is I see her everyday. As we work at the same job and I talk to her a lot. I think the worst part of it is she actually does not like me anymore. But I wish she would tell me, because all my little heart wants is to spend all its time loving someone else would actually cares about it. And it breaks me to know she probably doesn’t give a shit. But the worst part is im so loyal i cant even open up to anyone else. Its like im stuck in a endless torture. 

I have an inability to make or maintain friendships so I have no one to really talk to about how im feeling or my friends i do have are mentally strained of me talking about how i feel. I keep trying to tell them im suicidal but no one seems to care which doesn’t help with the intrusive thoughts. The past week has been the hardest I get more thoughts frequently and keep contemplating killing myself more and more. i cry when i drive to work and I cry myself to sleep. Ive wanted to kill myself ever since I was a child but people would come into my life who would keep me holding on, but after losing the person I thought i was going to be with for the rest of my life it has utterly destroyed me. Im so fractured I don’t know if i will make it out, i see her everyday. its terrible because all i want is for her to care about me, but she doesn’t so it destroys me. And i should probably be looking for a different job to get away from her but im so destroyed its left me completely useless to anything other then just going on with what I have.

Im also physically sick ontop of it, I have chronic eczema and living with full body eczema is mentally exhausting and i only really wanted to stay alive because of my ex being there and needing me but now im no longer wanted or needed so its very hard, yes i know my family loves me but that isn’t what i want in life.

And somehow i put on a smile and make everyone laugh at work and i seem to be the most positive person but im dying on the inside and its probably the only reason im so funny and nice because its all i can do to stop myself from breaking down

Like I don’t want to die but i hate being alive i hate feeling anything anymore it just hurts so much and im alone, i live alone, I haven’t been alone in so long, i hate being alone, alone with myself, alone with my thoughts, and im not looking for advice i just want some people to hear me. Because i cant say anything to my friends because ill just burden them, im sorry to even burden whos reading this but thank you for just reading.

I guess all i can do is wait and hope time will bring me peace but it’s getting really hard, ive only attempted suicide once when I was like 17-18. I was obviously unsuccessful but idk i got better ideas now. Im just hoping I can talk myself out of it, but I really don’t want to anymore.

I just have never had a heart break, break me so hard, we lived together we slept together we did everything together and now I just work with her and go home alone every night instead of with her. Alone to my ‘home’ that doesn’t even feel like home without someone to spend it with.

And I cannot even get a cat or a dog to spend my home with because im so allergic and my chronic health conditions would get unbearable :/

Maybe im not ready to start dating again but why does every girl have 1-3 cats, like damn. I don’t wanna make anyone get rid of their cats to date me so I just avoid them but like man, really sucks being allergic to shit, slims the options when every woman seems to love cats. Especially because id love to be able to touch cats and dogs :(. 

Okay I’ve typed enough to stop crying thank you for reading, I will probably start crying again but at least I have stopped for 3 mins. I hope whoever you are whos reading this is having a nice day/night. Or maybe my woes made you forget yours.

26 y/o male - Getting very close - scared myself for the first time and unsure of if it's only a matter of time before I go through with it,"(Starting my senior year of college)

&amp;#x200B;

September 2017:   
Body dysmorphia leads me to believe I have gynecomastia. Plastic surgery research occupies most of my time. Turns out to be basically negligible and a case that goes away if I lose weight (learned this much later on).

&amp;#x200B;

December 2017:   
After 6 scheduled (and cancelled) surgery dates with plastic surgeons to remove the gynecomastia, my parents recommend that I see our doctor and talk about depression. I oblige.

&amp;#x200B;

January 2018:   
After my first visit with the doctor, I start taking Zoloft 25mg 1x/day.

&amp;#x200B;

March 2018:   
I up the dosage to 50mg/day. Start complaining to doctor about ""emotional numbness"" and taper back down to 25mg 2x/day.

&amp;#x200B;

April 2018:   
I'm at a bar and get cold clocked (to this day I still do not know who hit me). Clean mandibular fracture and broken in two places. Wired shut for 4 weeks after that.

&amp;#x200B;

August 2018:   
Decide I'm good and that I don't need Zoloft anymore (was also very overweight). Go off the drug and two weeks later, I total my '01 BMW e46 M3 that I bought a year prior after running a stop light I didn't see. T-boned a taxi.

&amp;#x200B;

September 2018:   
Researching that Zoloft weakens bone density and increases risk of fractures by up to 75%. Thought of ""if you weren't on Zoloft, your jaw wouldn't have broken"" starts to grow in my head. call my mom on my birthday, mention suicide for the first time. She says I ""can't leave this earth"" in tears.

&amp;#x200B;

October 2018:   
Meet a new girl, we become boyfriend and girlfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

April 2019:   
I buy a penis enlargement device ""just because"" to see if I can get any bigger for my gf at the time. And mind you, I was not insecure about my size to begin with, I just wanted to see if it could get bigger. I ended up suffering an injury from doing too much, too fast that left my penis in a ""hard flaccid"" state sometimes, and actually lost a bit of length and girth because of it. This leads to a lot of anxiety and depression that I still experience to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

May 2019:   
Depressed, I decide to start Zoloft again. 25mg 1x/day.

&amp;#x200B;

September 2019:   
I go off of Zoloft again. Girlfriend and I break up.

&amp;#x200B;

October 2019 - January 2021:   
Working full-time, met another girl around Feb 2020 that I dated up until recently. Things we just OK. Covid didn't make things any easier, but whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

February 2021:   
I approach a urologist about the potential of Zoloft ruining my sex drive, and that's the reason I can't perform like I used to. I start doing research and come across Wellbutrin. I start taking Wellbutrin 100mg SR 1x/day.

&amp;#x200B;

March 2021:   
I go off of Wellbutrin.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Wellbutrin 100mg/1x per day continues for month-long streaks coupled with about a month off. This cycle repeats itself for about 3 months up until the middle of this past June.

&amp;#x200B;

\- - - - - - - - - - -

End of June 2021:   
I come across a bunch of photos of myself a year or two prior to the gynecomastia/Zoloft phase. Look myself and love what I see. My face looked different. I remember my penis looking and functioning the way it used to. I remember the way my teeth pressed together when I closed my mouth, and how my jaw didn't click everytime I opened it or when I gave my girlfriend oral.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*first scare here\*\* (July 2, 2021):   
I take my father's competition ruger out of the case next to his bed (I'm at my parent's house here). I hold it. I look at it. I wonder... I don't cry or whatever. I try to fight. I try to think about what I can do differently, but nothing really happens. I put the gun back in its case, and I decide to light a bowl and get high. I pass out at the top of my parent's stairs until 2pm in the afternoon. I had off of work, and the rest of the family is at our vacation house, so I was home alone.

&amp;#x200B;

July 3, 2021:   
I decide to do something, so I book a tee time and drop a 72 on 18-holes from the tips here at our home course, with a 33 (-3) on the back nine. Golf is a big passion of mine, and I have my own horror stories of trying to play in college/throughout highschool that I won't get into. I've played golf my entire life.

July 4, 2021 (today):   


I wake up, depressed again. Not high this time, but I start reading about people on psychiatric medications and how it can permanently mess them up. I start thinking about everything, from how my dick is fucked up, to how my face looks different from a jaw fracture I suffered because I chose to take antidepressants (and how the SSRIs probably weakened my bone density), how I pissed away good relationships with good women. Everything.  


I go back upstairs and take my Dad's ruger out again. I look at it. This time I cry a little bit. I start to realize I'm unstable and the only thing holding me back is that I really don't know how to operate a ruger, and the magazines are out (though there are bullets in the magazines). I frighten myself again, and put it back in the case. I cry to God a bit here and say ""I'm really having a tough time here man. I don't know what to do.""

I can't wait to fucking die,"I found a way to kill myself, now all I have to do is wait for the occasion; I'm going to get drunk and jump off a bridge into water. This is the most peaceful way to go I could come up with. I'm domestically abused by my mom and there's no way out of this household. The solution might seem obvious, get a job, save money, find a place to live. But the problem is that my mom won't let me move out because, according to our culture, women shouldn't move out of their parents house until they get a husband. She keeps threatening to kill me, get me tortured etc. even though I'm doing my best to appease her. When somebody else makes her mad she lashes out on me and my 3 younger half-sisters, who are basically being raised by me because my mom and step-father don't want to take care of them

Moving out secretly isn't an option either because in order to do that I'd have to have a job, and my mom won't let me get one. I don't even have a bank account despite being on the verge of turning 18. My school noticed that there's something wrong with me because I kept falling asleep in the middle of classes so they made me talk to my school counselor, I told her almosr everything so she contacted some organization that helps troubled young people. They were supposed to help me with moving out but they couldn't do anything, of course they didn't explicitly say that but they told me multiple times that my situation is ""very difficult"", that they're not sure what to do, they even straight up told me that I'm trapped. 

I'm constantly sleep-deprived due to having to take care of my little half-sisters all the time (even at night). I get woken up multiple times during a night because my 2 youngest sisters are VERY small and small children tend to not sleep well. Nearly every night I fall asleep past midnight and get woken up at roughly 6 or 7am.

Not to mention that I can't take a shower or go to the bathroom whenever I need to because my sisters might hurt themselves and/or each other if I take my eyes off of them.

My mom hid MY documents away from me, doesn't let me go out (I have to stay home 24/7, look after my 3 half-sisters and do chores), doesn't care about my education, forces her beliefs on me and physically and psychologically abuses me like I'm not obedient like a fucking dog. My mom isn't even employed, she never works. She either goes out with her friends or lounges at home and does nothing all day. I have no decent future ahead of me. Of course I'm not blaming everything on my mom, I brought some of this upon myself too.",ceramicalpic,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/odj58r/i_cant_wait_to_fucking_die/,found way kill wait occasion going get drunk jump bridge water peaceful way go could come domestically abused mom way household solution might seem obvious get job save money find place live problem mom let move according culture woman move parent house get husband keep threatening kill get tortured etc even though best appease somebody else make mad lash 3 younger half sister basically raised mom step father want take care moving secretly option either order job mom let get one even bank account despite verge turning 18 school noticed something wrong kept falling asleep middle class made talk school counselor told almosr everything contacted organization help troubled young people supposed help moving anything course explicitly say told multiple time situation difficult sure even straight told trapped constantly sleep deprived due take care little half sister time even night get woken multiple time night 2 youngest sister small small child tend sleep well nearly every night fall asleep past midnight get woken roughly 6 7am mention take shower go bathroom whenever need sister might hurt take eye mom hid document away let go stay home 24 7 look 3 half sister chore care education force belief physically psychologically abuse like obedient like fucking dog mom even employed never work either go friend lounge home doe nothing day decent future ahead course blaming everything mom brought upon,wait fucking die,2559,27

"My mother died, now I feel like following her.","My mother suddenly passed away from Kidney failure after I took care of her for 10 months. The stubborn woman didn't want anyone else helping her but me, and never wanted any help from the doctors, right up until I had to call 911 on June 7th. It was barely 27 days since. 

I have a job now that I barely started, and all my coworkers keep feeling me the same toxic positivity. I know it ain't their fault, they barely know me but have suffered loss before. But, I don't want to what any of that! I don't even care about my own life! I'm only alive because I know damn well that everyone I know will suffer immensely; I couldn't bare hurting them. But, I'm in pain and ideation is an occurrence for me everyday. 

I often dream about scenarios which I am dying and seeing my dead parents cause they gave me a sense of purpose. I've never had anything else as I've always been a people pleaser. 

I'm sick and tired of hearing that I should live for myself, love myself, and accept myself. You know what? I already do, barely have been over the past couple of years. But, I cannot stand one more year on this damn planet. It's all too much, and I /have/ to work with people who, (while right and totally valid in their sympathy), I don't want to talk to.

But to do that I have to destroy my life. I have to hurt my best friend. I have to hurt the only person on earth I want to escape the apocalypse with.

No easy way,"I have 30 paracetamol tablets (*500mg) currently next to my bedside. I'm male, 22 years old, average height, and maybe a little over my recommended body weight. This feels like the easiest way out available to me but I've read that it's slow &amp; painful and could lead to permanent damage when unsuccessful. I've been thinking about ending things for a while now. Honestly, in the past it was just a distant thought for the most part and I could just ignore it when I'd think about it but over the past year and a half I have pretty much spiralled down to probably the darkest point in my life and it's pretty much all I've been thinking about. I feel like I'm just a failure who has burned any potential future I had ahead of me, and I've even driven away close friends because of my poor decisions and my sometimes chaotic behavior recently. I really hate myself rn and am so disappointed in what I've amounted to. I've lost pretty much all motivation I had. The thought of suicide is starting to feel less abstract and more like a real potential outcome everyday. But the more real it feels the more I feel like there's no easy way out and I'm scared of surviving and living with permanent damage to myself. A few months ago I tried cutting myself, but never even went deep enough to make a real threat to my life. I was confident I'd be taking these pills only a few hours ago, but now that seems unlikely to me after reading more about it. I'm kind of scared. Idk what to do. I never really thought this would be me, like feeling this way and posting on a forum like this. But here I am. Feeling desperate and defeated and I guess I'm realizing I'm going to be here a little longer.

Want to kill myself to help my family,"Ok, so here's everything:

My son was nearly arrested and charged with creating, possessing, and distributing child porn when he was halfway thru 8th grade. This past May, he finished 9th grade.

The only reason he was NOT arrested and charged with these things is because I was able to convince the local PD that he was just trying to find naked pics of girls his own age to fap to. He was 13 at the time. It also helped that he was able to provide valuable intel that got an actual pedophile arrested and saved a fellow 13 year old classmate from being victimized by said pedo.

My husband and I finally relaxed our restrictions on his phone about 6 weeks ago.

On Thursday, I found evidence on his phone that he accessed some of his old child porn collection within the past week. The collection that was in a suspended account 2 years ago, but was somehow back to being 100% available within the last 2 weeks (they turned it into a honeypot to catch pedos).

He's 15 now. This account is not the only recent activity that he's managed to accumulate over the last 2-4 weeks. (He got around the browser restrictions I put in place using Facebook Messenger.  Keep your kids away from that!!!)

Knowing that he has a history of this, and immediately tried to find ways to access this smut the moment he knew he was less monitored leads me to believe that he will be contacted by law enforcement once again.

I can't do this shit again. I have severely debilitating arthritis and a few other conditions.  I have a good life insurance policy that I've paid into so long that, even if suicide is proven, cannot stop the payout. Said payout is just about exactly what we were told would be his legal defense fees 2 years ago. 

My kid seems to truly not care about any of this. I honestly believe he has some sort of mental illness, but his counselor has said the only thing she really suspects is ADHD.

I am diabetic. I am an insulin dependent diabetic. It would be a super simple thing for me to ""accidentally"" mix up my 70/30 insulin with my straight fast-acting insulin. 40 units of fast acting insulin while fasting might just do the trick. 80 (given my extreme memory issues, not too hard to do...I've done it before, but was awake to face the consequences. ) at bedtime would be a simple way to send my blood sugar plummeting into coma / death range.

If I manage to.die in the correct way to ensure my family gets my life insurance, that's  100k that can go toward either paying off our significant debt so my husband can hire a lawyer, or straight toward a legal defense for my son.

Will this fuck up my kid even more? Probably. Do I think he'll be so bad off mentally that he can't find a way to move forward? Not any more so than right this moment.

My kid is somewhat of the psychopath/sociopath that my husband is. He does not show emotion until ot overwhelms him. The detectives from both law enforcement agencies that he was in trouble with were sympathetic to a mother's struggle to control the raging hormones of a newly minted teen. 

Now, he's at the ""try him as an adult"" age, and they'll be gunning for him BIG TIME.

I've lost the last meaning in my life,"I've thought about ending it all so many times but now the time has come. I really start consider it as an option. Before this very day I always could convince myself that there is at least something to go for, one goal to achieve and work for but not anymore.
After more than 10 years I finaly met the love of my life and I really couldn't be happier that day, it was even more than I hoped for.
That didn't last until the end of the day though when she confessed to me the following things:
- It was purely exhausting for her and not a single minute of relaxation.
- Nothing ever had a meaning for her.
- She also said she had to meet someone in real life to have a connection to them, she didn't build up one to me though.
- The chances of her falling in love with me ever so slightly are even worse than before.
- She only desired me because her boyfriend neglected her.
- Cuddling with me never felt good for her in any way, she wanted to make me happy for at least one moment, which she achieved mind you.

She also told me she doesn't know yet if she even wants to see me again which hit the hardest of all. I didn't just lose all hope in ever being in a relationship with the woman I love but I also know now how much of a burden I am to even have around.
You might find my problems laughable but there really was nothing else in my life I ever had to go for but her and now I've ruined it by being myself.

“Others have it worse than me”,"I can’t be content with my life.

I just want to die... I feel like im a waste of space. Unwanted.,"27 female here. I'm having a lot of problems with depression right now due to my hypersexuality and the direct relation that my self worth and happiness ties into someone showing me attention physically. 

I feel like a failure because I need SO much physical attention or else I slip into severe depression and get suicidal and I hate it so much. And before, I could just be ok getting it from anyone- didnt matter who. It all made me feel good and worthy. But I moved in with this guy and I only want it from him. Its like I'm on drugs with him. And then when I dont have it, I get like this. I dont want to keep going through this. It hurts so fucking much. 
We arent dating either so its not like he has to show me any attention in any way in the first place. He says he loves me. Says he wants to be with me. But I dont believe it. If he wanted me, wouldnt we be together? I feel like im just being used... Like im only here for if he needs sex, and I get thinking this way and then get really depressed, and then he will go and do something or say something or kiss me, and its like nothing happened. I forgive it all. Im so madly in love with him, I'm willing to go through being suicidal even if I get to feel on top of the world even for a minute from him. 
I feel like im broken. I feel like im fucked up. I feel like I shouldnt be basing my self worth directly on how much physical attention or sex he gives me. I know I shouldn't. But I dont know how to change this. Being bipolar and having BPD also add to the shit show.

Ive been acting as a therapist to partner who wants to end his life.,"As the title says; I’ve been trying to help my partner for years with his suicidal thoughts/tendencies. He won’t seek help and doesn’t want to take medication. 

A little backstory, his father committed suicide when my partner was only 18. Now at age 32, he’s had no grief counseling and still has unresolved issues. We’ve been together for 6 years and have a daughter together. 
 
I’m the main caretaker of the house. I care for our child, pets, pay bills, clean, ect. Because he struggles with anxiety as well, I essentially care for him as well. Right down to scheduling doctors appointments for him . 
Along with the suicidal tendencies, there’s also disrespectful name calling, verbal abuse and manipulation towards me. Now, I’m not a perfect person but I feel no one should be treated as such. Let alone in front of our 6 year old. 

I’m at a loss of what to do because things have drastically escalated in the past months. He plans on “disappearing” sooner than later. If I try to leave, he tells me it’ll speed up the process and it’ll make things worse.

It's like an obsession or compulsion, a constant pressure to do more and more, it's never enough and I justify it to myself as being immoral *not* to do these things so long as there is something that could be done. I've always been like this, I've just never directed it into anything meaningful. I just feel like in today's society there are far too many avenues to failure, and myself being someone who had a bright future yet failed due to mental health reasons, I don't want that to happen again. 


Anyway, I'm basically what someone would call a ""tryhard"", at life. And because of this I'm a strange person and feel lonely as fuck.


For the record I do have friends and I'm not really the uptight type, I don't take things seriously that aren't meant to be, but the things that are, I just get extremely fixated and focused on them.

He knows I’m severely depressed and suicidal, Well something came up on his end and he canceled. Haven’t heard from him since and he won’t return any texts or calls.

How to refocus after a disastrous day?,"I had a really horrible day. I've been taking a new medication for anxiety and have had depression and suicidal ideation in the past, but it hasn't been a major issue for some time, just very mild. Today, my friend who is watching my dog lost her for 3 hours. My ex boyfriend still has a number on one of her tags so I called him to tell him to answer the phone if he gets an out of state number. Luckily my dog was found, but my ex told me my friend was incredibly mad at me, and it turns out that my friend was pissed at me for underlying resentments about feeling unappreciated and the dog fiasco brought it to a head. My ex took this opportunity to try to resume communication with me and continued calling me throughout the day, and saying lots of things that he probably thought were benign, but were making me feel terrible and I kept telling him I was overwhelmed and upset because of my friend's sudden anger at me and a sense that I was a terrible person, because this friend is like family to me. My ex kept calling me and our conversation got more and more complicated and heated, and he ended up telling me I was burning bridges with anyone that cared about me, that I was selfish, that I didn't appreciate anything he had done for me. We broke up over a year ago actually because he drank a lot and would yell at me and make me cry often, but for the last year after our breakup, he's been trying to 'improve' himself and 'repair' things with us, which I haven't really been open to but felt guilty and continued lines of communication with him, which I regret doing because I'm starting to realize that he can be manipulative and makes me feel awful. Our last conversation I kept trying to get off the phone, and he got more and more angry because he could tell, and I finally told him that apparently, I was an awful person and crazy, and he said, 'Well all my friends think so' and I said, if I'm so crazy why don't you leave me the fuck alone? He hung up on me, and I messaged my friend telling my friend I was sorry if he ever felt unappreciated, I told him I had had a really bad day, was having a bit of a breakdown, and that I had been feeling suicidal today (only today, I hadn't had a serious feeling in a while) and my friend told me that he felt our friendship was built on a dysfunctional foundation. I started to feel like the foundation of my relationships (my friends, since I am estranged from my family) was all based on dysfunction and it was my fault. I started wishing I had the guts to take my life, and for hours ruminated over the pain and wish that I could have the courage to go through with it. After hours of agony, I called the suicide hotline, and within just a short amount of time I started to feel better. But yesterday was a complete waste, a complete drain, emotional and phsyical. I have so much work to do for school and for research in general, and I feel like my breakdown has set me back and I just cannot figure out how to get back on track. I feel almost like a hangover today (I didn't drink yesterday but just one beer, which I made myself throw up because my stomach was hurting so badly) but an emotional stress hangover.

CW Transphobia: Sometimes I just want to die,"Repost because I forgot the trigger warning last time.

I apologize for posting this. I really don’t want to waste anyone’s time, especially when other people have much worse problems then me, but I really want to get this off my chest.

I’m pretty sure I’m a trans mtf, but I don’t think I’ll ever be able to live happily and I go back and forth on being suicidal or just living.

Often times I can go a long time without feeling suicidal at all, but only if I distract myself with escapism.

June was a great month for me. Nintendo had a great E3, the Bluebox conspiracy was fun even though it ended up being nothing in the end, Fortnite started one of the best seasons in recent times, I beat Xenoblade Chronicles, and hung out with friends a bit. Even though I had to avoid anything pride related like the plague I was able to live in my own little world and enjoy myself.

Now for whatever reason my dysphoria is back and I hate it. I want to transition but have no idea how to get a therapist to start the process, and can’t even imagine coming out to my parents/friends due to my fear’s. I often consider coming out to one friend who I know supports trans people, but I can’t bring myself to do it.

Summer is always the worst since everyone is posting bikini pics, and I’m sitting here as an ugly male. 

When I get really down I honestly consider suicide as a viable option, but I don’t think I can go through with it knowing that I’m causing pain for other people, so I just grit my teeth and try not to think about it.

I hate that I either have to somehow overcome the seemingly impossible task of transitioning for a chance of living happily, or have to distract myself so the pain goes away.

Honestly I really hope PlayStation has their game announcement event soon so I can distract myself with something fun.",Confusedegg224,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oddc3b/cw_transphobia_sometimes_i_just_want_to_die/,repost forgot trigger warning last time apologize posting really want waste anyone time especially people much worse problem really want get chest pretty sure trans mtf think ever able live happily go back forth suicidal living often time go long time without feeling suicidal distract escapism june wa great month nintendo great e3 bluebox conspiracy wa fun even though ended nothing end fortnite started one best season recent time beat xenoblade chronicle hung friend bit even though avoid anything pride related like plague wa able live little world enjoy whatever reason dysphoria back hate want transition idea get therapist start process even imagine coming parent friend due fear often consider coming one friend know support trans people bring summer always worst since everyone posting bikini pic sitting ugly male get really honestly consider suicide viable option think go knowing causing pain people grit teeth try think hate either somehow overcome seemingly impossible task transitioning chance living happily distract pain go away honestly really hope playstation ha game announcement event soon distract something fun,cw transphobia sometimes want die,1825,44

Can I convince my friend to get help?,"My (F18) friend (M17) texted me saying that he needs help with his depression and if he doesn’t get it he’s going to end up killing himself. He’s been struggling with depression for years, and we’ve talked about it multiple times over the course of our friendship. He always says he has nothing to look forward to and he feels like a burden to everyone around him. He uses alcohol, weed, and work to cope. 

I want to convince him to talk to a professional, but I don’t know if that’s possible. He knows he needs help, but he refuses to try to get it. He says that he doesn’t want to be a burden to anyone and he promised himself that he’s never going to ask anyone for help.

really sorta struggling,"Usually I struggle to talk about things like the direct topic of suicide, but recently I have been having a lot of dangerous thoughts. I think I still have some hope so I really don't expect myself to, but a lot has been happing to me. both of my parents are alcoholics and my mother is disabled, so we have always been rather financially strained. Recently, one of my aunts sadly passed away (and I wasn't able to travel and say goodbye which I strongly dislike), but because of this we have money from her estate coming , but it has really been straining everything since my mom tends to get somewhat controlling and stubborn when the topic of buying things is in the convo. My dad is never home because he has a girlfriend (my mom knows, she is fine with it), so he never has much say in anything. And meanwhile I usually get swept up by toxic friend groups online, and I suspect I have quite a few mental disorders but until I am professionally diagnosed, I don't trust myself with that task. I have lost nearly all of the personality I have had over the year and am so matter of fact now and I can't stand it. I never express emotions much either because I tend to hold them in a lot. Due to the financial strain, we have had to move a lot so keeping friends is impossible. And if it isn't us moving its them moving, so I have never had a friend for more than a year or so in person, but I have lots of friends online who tend to stick to talking about me being financially unwell or physically unwell.  I've decided I can't rely on my personality so I need to rely on looks more to make relationships even if it is with undesirable people, which is really pushing my physical limits and makes me feel sick rather often. I am medium in that aspect, and am somewhat intelligent I assume but based off of my grades for the past year, if I am intelligent then I am also really awful at time management and study tactics. I don't even know where this is going anymore (if you cant tell, I am very much a rambler), but I just really wish I had someone to talk to other than myself.

I've lost the battle.,"After all these years and all the things I've been through I am thowing in the towl.

I hate myself with a passion but at the same time I will admit that I'm proud of myself for making it this far. I truly never thought I could do it. Even before the pandemic I endured abuse, social exclusion, and intense loneliness at school for years. I even got to graduate high school. But all of this has taken such a hight toll on me and I just don't have it in me anymore. I seriously can't do this anymore and I don't see much of a point either. I recently decided I would pull a middle finger on the universe and I finally realised that all this pain wasn't worth it. In fact it was all for nothing.

"Need to process some things. I've been self harming for a decade, tomorrow I'm going to my 8th treatment center (6th one I've been to in the last year), and I just cut myself for the first time in 3 months","I'm not even feeling particularly suicidal right now, I just need to process a bit, so please feel free to ignore this. I just didn't know where else this was appropriate to post but felt like I needed to get some of this out of my head. NSFW since I go into some detail about cutting myself. Seriously don't read this honestly. I'll probably delete it once my self control comes back online tomorrow.

I just cut again for the first time in about 3 months. Last time I cut was in a lockdown treatment center, with a hairclip I broke in half and spent 45 minutes in the bathroom digging at the same spot on my arm until fat started coming out and the nurse took me to the ER for stitches. The hairclip was blunt, the cut was was dirty and jagged and messy, it took a long time, it hurt a lot, and it didn't even really help or make me feel better. And then I felt a whole lot worse because I got dropped acuity levels and put on suicide watch, which made everything a million times worse. 

This time I did it in my bathroom at home with a double edged razor. I did a few shallow practice cuts on my calf since I haven't cut in a while. Then made 3 small cuts on my wrist. Went over them a few times til they were deep enough that I could be satisfied (comparatively still pretty shallow by my standards; probably just shallow styro, not that it actually matters). 

It hurt more than I was expecting. It didn't hurt a lot, but last year when I was cutting a lot and very deeply, I could hit styro in one swipe and barely feel it. This time, even just basically giving myself a papercut with the razor stung. Kinda felt pathetic for that. As I kept going it hurt less and less, especially when I went over the same ones a few times to make them deeper. I also forgot how much I hate blood. They bled more than I was expecting, not a lot by any means, I'm just really impatient when it comes to bleeding; it's my least favorite part of cutting, it's just so inconvenient. 

It still helped, which is kind of fucked. I don't feel anything now - nothing emotionally, and the cuts don't hurt either. Which is good, not feeling anything is a good thing and the reason I cut in the first place. I'm glad it still helps even though it's fucked that it still helps. 

I probably just fucked myself in the ass though; I'm going to a new treatment center on Monday (flying out tomorrow, crashing at a hotel and arriving Monday morning), and them knowing I just cut will mean I'll probably be on closer watch and have less freedom. I hid a few razors in my stuff that they probably won't find, just in case I need them. I feel better just knowing they're there if I need them. 

I started cutting myself when I was 11. I'm 20 years old now; that's almost a decade of cutting myself and that's kind of insane to think about. I've been self harming for longer than that; even as a kid I was scratching myself, giving myself bruises, and pulling out my hair (had to shave my head 'cause of trichotillomania when I was 16. lol I'm a very well-rounded fuckup, fucked in all aspects). 

I've been stuck in a cycle of treatment centers and hospitals for the past year and it's helped in some ways but made things a lot worse in others. I'm just really fucking tired and I don't really have hope that things will ever get better or that I'll ever get better or ever be able to be happy or live as a functioning, content human being and member of society.

I Dont Recognize Myself Anymore,"In February, I was in a relationship I didn't want to be in anymore, and the smiles were fake. Then I left my husband, and it was hard, then it got easier and I had friends and the smiles turned real. 

In early July I've now lost my best friend's, my roommates, I have my babies staying with a friend because I don't want them to see me like this, I've almost attempted suicide 3 times in the last month, I've lost 50 lbs, spiraled into an eating disorder, turned into a dangerous jaded cynical selfish piece of shit, and I can't even recognize myself apart from pictures from three weeks ago, let alone five months ago.

I almost killed myself Wednsday and it was the closest I ever came to guaranteed death, and I talked myself down, and I regret it? I just disappeared for two days, and I get home yesterday, and my best friend's upset his cat got out the night I disappeared and wasn't back yet? I felt like I was going to puke, and I still feel like my stomach is in my chest. How'd I fuck up so badly my best friend is more upset about his cat being lost a couple days than he was that I'm lost right now?

It feels like I never walked out of the woods. It feels like maybe I did fucking die or whatever part of me that actually wanted to live and not just go through the daily motions and survive is just dead? It feels like I'm watching myself from far away as everything I love crumbles, and it feels like I'm witnessing first hand and that I was right, everyone is better off without me. I'm slipping, and I'm slipping so fast I have nothing to hold onto. It honestly feels like I'm watching as people move on from me being in their lives, and I'm not even dead yet. I'm a ghost to everyone I love, and I'm still fucking alive to see it. 

I tried to go for a drive today, and all my music just reminds me of people I loved that are either dead now, or no longer love me. I can't listen to the music of my childhood without hearing the love of my life strumming along next to me and singing so badly while I sang over him. All our favorite alternative songs that used to be comforting are suffocating me now. All the music from the last few years makes me think of my ex husband and the awkward silences on car rides while the radio played a song I didn't have the energy to sing to anymore. Panic! Makes me think of the drives with the man I loved but never had the right to. Pink! Makes me think of the best friend that never came home to me and died on the way home to me instead. All the newest 200 or so songs make me think of the last few months with the best friendship I've ever known, the most my music taste has been expanded I years, and now every single fucking note makes me want to drive the car into a tree and never feel loss again.

I tried to take a few selfies today. I don't recognize myself. I look haunted, and hollow, and fucking empty. I look fucking soulless. Every single part of me that was me is gone and the last time I felt like this was at my best friend's funeral, staring down at her in the casket and everything in my brain screaming at me to walk away, look away, this isn't her anymore. 

This isn't me anymore. I'm not me anymore. I tried to get help last week. I went to the hospital I come back and everything is worse now. I wanted to kill myself last week, and I got help, and it didn't help. It didn't fix me. Nothing can fix me but everyone wants me to be fixed. I went in Tuesday, got out Saturday, and by Wednesday night I'm sitting in the woods holding razors and sobbing while I tried to think of any reason not to just let go. I found a reason, and I committed myself to really REALLY doing it. No more trying cause that leaves room for failing and I can't right? So I dye my hair my favorite hair color that I've kept it for so long to make myself feel better and more like myself, and it doesn't help. It doesn't feel like me. I get home I clean I take my meds I work I accomplish goals I bring my kids home and I feel so much better and my best friend comes home and I ask him if I'm allowed to just hug him and he says no. He still doesn't forgive me. 

I know they're going through things. I know I can't rely on them they can't pour from an empty cup and I'm fucking PROUD OF HIM for making choices in his life FOR HIM even if I don't agree with those choices. I'm proud of my other best friend and roommate for being so fucking strong and brave while her heart is shattered, but I'm not asking them to pour anything. I'm not asking them to fix me. I'm not asking them to guide me, I'm not asking them to let me lean on them, I just wanted them to stand by my side. I wanted anyone to just stand by my side because I can't save me from myself when the only thing that's kept me going for 11 years now is knowing how badly it would hurt the people I love, and now I know it's not true. It was selfish of me to expect them to care when they have their own shit to handle, but I don't care about me anymore and I just desperately need anyone else to. I just wanted to hang out. Go for a drive, listen to music play a video game do ANYTHING to distract myself from the fact that everything I love is systematically falling apart. I wanted to laugh again with the funniest man I've ever met. I wanted to parent my kids again with the best mom I've ever known. I wanted to clean the house with loud music and dance around with the kids surrounding us and sit at the table and maybe have someone to eat with that makes eating feel like less of a daunting task while I'm losing weight so rapidly my doctors are all concerned for my health and safety. Their other friends hang out, but their other friends aren't a fucking basket case like I am. I'm lonely, and I'm empty, and I'm sad, and I'm dejected, and I'm spiraling and self destructing and it's like I'm watching as everyone I love moves on from my loss while I'm still alive. I'm still right here, I feel like I'm made of glass and it's starting to splinter and pretty soon I'll just shatter completely and that will be the end of it.

Every reason I had to stay is crumbling. My kids deserve a mother that's not broken. My friends deserve a friend that isn't too broken to be around. They don't see the pain and the fear and the glass and the way I've turned into someone I don't know and don't recognize they don't see that I'm fucking pounding on the walls trying desperately to break them down and let someone in before I can't save me from myself anymore they just see the attitude and the rejection they don't see that the isolation isn't what I want or need. I don't want to be not home right now. I don't want to be not with my kids right now. I want to be me again. I want to be home and safe and loved and welcomed and I want someone to find me and see ME and see that I'm still alive and I'm still trying when everything in me doesn't want to anymore I'm giving it a chance I'm giving it a try and I'm failing so fucking badly because I'm doing it alone and it's officially the day I decided I'd kill myself if it didn't get better by July 4th. It's independence day. A day of freedom. The 5 year anniversary of my first suicide attempt. Things aren't better. They're worse. They're so much worse and every single day I wake up with hope and every single day I go to bed crying so hard no sound comes out.

this is it for me apologize for if i type badly i am in distress,"I have BPD. my boyfriend  of 10 years and I have been fighting, I have been unable to control my emotions past 2 weeks bc he has beeen at a bachelor party and had family ov for aweek and his family doesnt know of me so we dont talk . though i have been  in intensive therapy and practicing DBT religiously, geting better i cant seem to l keep it consistent. i break down and have bad days esp when we dont speak fora  whole day. 

this is what leads to it. -w eboth did not sleep for 36  hours -for him due to stress, for me i chose ot stay up due to i have no time as i am oveworked and enjoy a night with video games and a friend. 


he was unable to sleep the prev night due to work stress ocd, it was 7 pm the day after sleepless nights and he want s to go to sleep i have not spoekn to him much in the last 2 weeks because he is unabvailable due to bachelor party week and family - btw his fam does not know baout me at all. so ihavent spoek n  to him much . he has not wanted to see me on face time or hear my voice lately ihave felt very unwanted but thsi leads to me being desperat when hes around.   


bc i miss him so much im panicking crying begging and did not want to say goodnight on the phone. we are LDR i panicked begged until he said yes. i took a lot of anxiety pills bt nothing worked. he kept demanding to getoff the phone and  

he is very silent and unresposive on the phone last night  finally i am so panicke and cannot breathe it is  impossible for me to even use words so i ahe to text whie im on the phone, i feel i canot breathe. he cant understand me.. i really fucked this all up bad. if ucked this up relly bad i am sorry.  
i say please go to bed i wil go.. we hang up  ..

heres today what it is now:  
i woke up to tis series of text from him: at 2 and  3 am:        
Don’t wake me up. I repeat. Do not wake me up.     

I’m panicking. My body is so fucked up from earlier that it’s felt like it can’t sleep. My throat started doing this acid reflux sort of thing when I was on the phone. Then my body started hurting. Head started hurting. Got light headed. Since then I’ve been having trouble breathing and I feel wired. I literally have slept 1 hour in the past 2 days. Feel like I’m dying.     

Heart hurts. This relationship is literally killing me    



i knwo this is it.   he will now be leving me. 
.i know i will not survive wihtout him though and i knwo because he left me for 2 years and i stopped eating not by choice, coudl not eat and have permanent damage from it now,it is not his fault. i just couldnt survive was in therapya t the time too, nobody could help. i know what i am in for.

I don’t get the point of life.,"Right now I’m in a depressed state - the relationship I thought was “the one” is over, I’m in debt, I have two friends to my name, my career is going nowhere and I’m constantly struggling to make ends meet. I do not understand the point of living. It’s a constant struggle. 

The thing is, even when I’m not depressed, I still don’t get the point of being alive. I’m always very aware that any happiness I feel is just temporary - things always fuck up. Or I fuck them up. I’m not good in relationships; I’m not a people person. 

If someone told me I could just push a button and I wouldn’t exist anymore, I’d push it. The only reason I’m still here is because I’m too scared to try anything. I’m scared of the pain and I’m scared of it failing and me ending up on a psych ward. 

I feel so lonely and I just want to love and be loved. I know that people will read this and will think that I don’t have any real problems, and they’d be right - others have it much worse than I do. I can’t help how I feel though. And I can’t help that it’s so hard to feel joy in anything. I don’t even want to fix it because I just don’t understand the point of it all. I just want out (I’ve wanted out for over 15 years). 

I’m not really looking for advice; I just want to be heard.

Depression is like a mental cancer,"Depression is like a mental cancer. All with different stages that can span many years of a persons life. Some people manage to beat depression, while others do not and usually succumb to it via suicide. 

I feel like I have watched myself slowly descend deeper and deeper into the pit of depression over many years of my life. At first it was manageable and I was still able to go about my life. Things got harder and harder and my depression grew and became more debilitating. 

My sense of identity diminishing as I became less of myself and more of just an embodiment of my own depression. Stage IV is the stage where it’s hardest to overcome. Suicidal thoughts run rampant. 

The suicidal thoughts grow and keep growing and slowly become what your mind is fixated on. At this point in my life I know my fate will be suicide. I know this is what I’ll succumb to. My mind cannot keep going, it cannot keep enduring. This cancer of depression has spread and taken over my head. Some people get lucky, I am not. 

Suicide is not a matter of if— but when. Soon people will realize how much pain I have been and continue to be in. But that will be too late. Such is life.",jeterthecat,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/od5p20/depression_is_like_a_mental_cancer/,depression like mental cancer different stage span many year person life people manage beat depression others usually succumb via suicide feel like watched slowly descend deeper deeper pit depression many year life first wa manageable wa still able go life thing got harder harder depression grew became debilitating sense identity diminishing became le embodiment depression stage iv stage hardest overcome suicidal thought run rampant suicidal thought grow keep growing slowly become mind fixated point life know fate suicide know succumb mind cannot keep going cannot keep enduring cancer depression ha spread taken head people get lucky suicide matter soon people realize much pain continue late life,depression like mental cancer,1170,34

:),"i'm quite happy to be dying soon. going to have my fun. i will not be changing my mind. hopefully this will be a goodbye. 

my story is proof that not everyone can have a good ending. some people just have to end up alone on the streets with a pair of scissors. but it's whatever. natural selection i guess. 

the system is broken. survivors of abuse are greeted with more abuse once ""help"" is on the way. if you are not conforming you are fucked. if you do not fit the molds you are discarded. medicated. thrown into a cell. discarded as worthless you're treated like a monster.

the world isn't kind. it never was. not to me at least. i have not felt human in a very long time. i have not experienced human things in a very long time. touch. love. hope. human things, i used to crave them. but, not anymore. i only crave to be put to sleep. 

stuck in my own head they say. an old soul. well behaved. these words have followed me my whole life. surely, i was something more? but no. i am nothing more than my body. an empty shell inside.

i want to recap some memories for the last part of this digital note. being 4 years old, on my dads shoulders walking past an archway and hitting my head, bleeding. at 7 learning about self esteem and wondering its use, thinking of what was wrong if i did not have any. going into 6th grade at 11 knowing everything about sex. cutting my wrists before gym class at 13. being abused by a lover at 15. 16th birthday.

I destroyed the most important relationship in my life.,"It happened. The bridge is burned. I don't think I can ever come back from this damage. I was a toxic asshole a lot of the times, and it somehow didn't lead to the termination of our contact.But this time, I've finally done it. I've became such a fucking toxic son of a bitch, that I don't think I'll ever have this person back.For the background I have NPD.And now, after I destroyed this relationship, I don't want to live anymore. I hate, I hate, let me repeat, I hate myself, so fucking much, that I just want to go jump of a cliff or shoot my brains out.I really don't want and can't imagine living without this person in my life. I know that its all my fault. I know that I could have act differently and this particular person gave me a lot, a lot, a lot of chances, and I fucked them all up.I don't know if I can keep going. Every single day is painful. I have dreams of talking to this person everynight and then I wake up, realise that I still live in a world where I fucked everything up.I still have hope, which is probably fucking foolish of me, that maybe if I better myself, if I go to the therapy consistently, get meds, maybe then I can become a better person and maybe then I can win this person back somehow. But that's fucking foolish of me. Everyone that I've talked to about this relationships shares this sentiment that its way too much, I've fucked up too much, It can't be fixed.

I can't shake the feeling that I'm not who I was supposed to be. I'm just a burden on the ones I love.,"I remember I tried ketamine infusions with a psychiatrist for about 8 months with no success. Just debt. When I applied and talked with the psychiatrist to see if I was eligible for the infusions, as most people my age (24) are not eligible, the doctor was shocked at how extensive my medication history was. He said it was like the medication list of a 70 year old, needless to say he said I was eligible 3 times over. Too bad it didn't help. 

Also tried 3 rounds of TMS at some point. No help :(

I see a psychiatrist now who's so good compared to typical ones in my area that he doesnt accept insurance, because he has tons of patients either way. Over 300$/appointment. He's the best psych I've ever had, but it's been about a year and a half and I'm still in this hole.

I have an appointment next thursday that I can't afford, and it'll nearly max out my 5,000$ limit credit card. And I'm not even fucking irresponsible with my money. Or at least when I had money.

I couldn't even hold down a fucking 10$/hr retail job at a small pet supply store. I was one of the best employees, always working hard but smart, but mentally it's such a joke how big of a toll it takes on me, I was having these really serious mental breakdowns once a week.

I used to draw when I was like 14-17 but my passion for that is just completely dead. I grew to hate my art.

The only thing I love is music, and I don't like saying this because I don't want to sound pretentious or whatever but like... it's the one thing I'm actually good at. Composing, improvising, guitar &amp; bass... but I dont think I'll ever be able to share it because I don't know anyone, all my friends have moved to different states and even when I tried to find people to play music with I was just met with indifference or apathy. 

And thats okay. I dont want to force anyone.. I just wish I could share it with people and spread that happiness. Like I wish I had friends I could make a band with. But it's just a pipe dream. I'll probably have to sell my fucking guitar soon.

I can't get through college. I'll never be able to make more than minimum wage, but honestly I can't even hold down a minimum fucking wage job.

I'm just a financial and emotional burden on my mom. She lost her job as a union lawyer (pandemic related) and is now making way less. I try to pay for my own shit but I have almost nothing now. Soon I won't even be able to get my prescriptions.

A couple days ago I was cutting my face open with a pair of scissors. Also all over my arm. I almost never self harm but something just took over me. I wasn't bleeding like crazy or anything, but it definitely looks like a cat mauled me. Had a lot of explaining to do to family.

It doesn't help that I have a pretty bad case of fibromyalgia and doctors don't believe me or take me seriously when I say I'm in excruciating pain because I'm a 24 year old boy who MUST just be a lying junkie trying to get opiates to get high. I just cry after half of my doctor appointments.

I have a sister with a medical MJ card and I tried it about 3 times to see if it helped with pain, all it did was make me paranoid and in more pain. Then 3 weeks later I got drug tested at a pain doctor and marijuana came up and he scolded me and called me a liar and said he wouldn't treat a druggie.

I have no money left. I won't be able to see my doctors, or get my prescriptions. My mom says we'll figure it out, but I know she's struggling like she's never struggled before, and it's just us. If I was gone it'd break her heart. But I find endless reasons to rationalize how much better it'd be for others if I was gone. Im such a fucking burden

I was the 'planned' child. I was the one who was supposed to go to college and be successful. I'm named after my father, who I have no relationship with, but he was the 'smart' one among his siblings. I'm not stupid, but I can't even take 2 college classes without fucking breaking down and barely passing.

I can rarely think straight now a days because I'm always in pain. And always mentally hurting. I should just kill myself, it just echoes in the back of my head. I dont even know why I'm posting this. I rarely post anything.

My experience w/ Lifeline Au,"I’m not sure if this is the place to share it but idk where else I’d talk about it. 
The other day I was at my mates apartment and he broke down crying talking about how he wanted to kill himself for almost two hours. He was also on the phone to his mother (she’s in qld we were in nsw) and he refused to let me call an ambulance or get help and his mother told me not to either. It was a very scary experience for me and I didn’t know what to do. I’ve never seen someone like that and I’ve never in my life felt the way I felt in that moment.
I had left the room for about 5 minutes to call lifeline outside for help on what to do. Someone answer and asked what I needed, I told him my mate was very upset and saying he was going to kill himself and I didn’t know what to do or how to help, the man on the phone told me to call an ambo and the police. I told him that wasn’t an option and he repeated himself. At this point I was balling my eyes out and said it wasn’t an option again and he just said “idk what the situation is but you need to call an ambulance”. 
It frustrated me hearing this as he didn’t even try to find out more information about the situation or the people involved nor did he help me in any sort of way on what I should do. I ended up hanging up on him and going back to my mate. I never expected such a shit response from someone who you are meant to call in times like that. The whole situation was traumatic and I can’t get over the fact that a number made to help people not kill themselves failed in more ways than one.

man i feel hopeless (15 boy),"So hi. I really cannot wrap my head around school stuff-i get 3s in my mock exams, i always get the lowest in my friend group, i cant keep my concentration up for any longer than 10 mins when revising, teachers dont help, the school doesnt tell us when our mock exams actually are. 

I have no day where i am not stressed about something, whetehr thats my future, the past or the present. I mainly worry about failure-i dread a life where i cannot own my dream cars, my dream homes etc. I literally cannot be poor, working class or middle class as everything i enjoy involves a fuck tone of money.

All i want out of my life is to be in F1, i dont want anything else. Racing is what im born to do, but since im born poor its essentially impossible ill ever make it to f1 and that scares me. All im good at is racing, and all i enjoy is driving. Im very good at it to, i can make a career out of it but i dont have £20 million pounds for all the juniour open wheel legues so ill probably never get the recocnition i deserve.

School wise, im stupid. I put effort in, i get no reward. 

so, i wonder whats even the point of living. i mean i aint good at school, nor do i have the funds to make a career out of something i enjoy-so what is left for me? a supermarket job or some other low payinmg hell hole? im probably gonna cut it short soon if it stays the way it is, i genuienly have no hope. If only i was born rich man, id be able to do what makes me happy-race cars. But no, i gotta study some bullshit poems or some other lesson i couldnt care less about. 

I just dont wanna live anymore-i cant live a normal life-i cant but it seems thats how its gonna work out. I pray that im reading this in 6 years while getting ready to go to silverstone to race for Williams in f1, oh do i beg but its probably not gonna happen and if it doesnt ill have nothing left.

life aint fun when you enjoy expensive hobbies but born poor. I beg for the FIA  to make this sport more accesible, but until that date ever comes i have no hope. I dont even think ill live long enough to see it happen.

i cant stop jacking off either, im so addicted to it as i dont feel dophamine any other time of the day so i do it to feel something for once. life aint fun man, it aint.",whatonEarthhh333,11,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/od4tq1/man_i_feel_hopeless_15_boy/,hi really cannot wrap head around school stuff get 3 mock exam always get lowest friend group cant keep concentration longer 10 min revising teacher dont help school doesnt tell u mock exam actually day stressed something whetehr thats future past present mainly worry failure dread life cannot dream car dream home etc literally cannot poor working class middle class everything enjoy involves fuck tone money want life f1 dont want anything else racing im born since im born poor essentially impossible ill ever make f1 scare im good racing enjoy driving im good make career dont 20 million pound juniour open wheel legues ill probably never get recocnition deserve school wise im stupid put effort get reward wonder whats even point living mean aint good school fund make career something enjoy left supermarket job low payinmg hell hole im probably gonna cut short soon stay way genuienly hope wa born rich man id able make happy race car gotta study bullshit poem lesson couldnt care le dont wanna live anymore cant live normal life cant seems thats gonna work pray im reading 6 year getting ready go silverstone race williams f1 oh beg probably gonna happen doesnt ill nothing left life aint fun enjoy expensive hobby born poor beg fia make sport accesible date ever come hope dont even think ill live long enough see happen cant stop jacking either im addicted dont feel dophamine time day feel something life aint fun man aint,man feel hopeless 15 boy,2256,28

"Honestly, I'm here for attention. I'm just sick of life and sick of the nonsense.","I feel like life is worthless to me.

From 5-16 years my stepdad was slowly becoming more abusive, and I constantly felt the need to protect my mom from his bullshit.

My mom was whack, though. Everyone seemingly is. One of the points of my life. One of the reasons I can't and don't even want to try to get any help anymore. Everyone has issues.

From 16-25, I had this excessive stress psychosis thing. I got diagnosed with schizo. Took endless pills and it never helped.

Started to meditate at 25. And it suddenly worked and helped lots. But it's been a constant struggle against my life, myself, the feeling that the world is hostile and will never heal, and the feeling that it's just completely pointless and broken no matter what I do. When I think about it, the pain matters to me, but in the end it's a pointless flash in the dark of a mere 100 years or less of my existence.

The way I feel just goes back to hellish. Over and over.

I once loved people, my relatives and such. But now I'm realizing they're purely there because they want a part of me, I'm left as somewhat of an afterthought. If I get worse, I also get fucked, and no-one ever shows any gratitude for the happiness I bring to them.

I just hate the systems.

I hate people one-upping each other.

I hate the constant subtle causing of pain. Constant dominating of others for such a vain and pitiful reason.

I hate the ignorance in the world.

And I hate how void and empty it seems.

I wish I could at least feel better.

Despite all of this, I've never hurt anyone. I've always held back, but even that avoidance is coming to fucking bite me.

I'm compulsive. I'm tired. I'm stressing myself out no matter what I do.

It's just emptiness, and I don't want it. I don't want to feel any of it.

I also hate how fake people are. Esp. on reddit. I don't think anyone realizes that anger and hate are very much alive and excused here. It always gets its way. You can't actually stop an emotion from expressing itself, especially if you don't pay attention to it. It's like a bill you have to pay or go to jail for whatever you've committed.

Fuck. I'm sorry if I don't make sense.

"Beware, a huge rant ://","So I wrote this thing in the assistance subreddit but it was probably a bad sub choice because the mods took it down lol I can't blame them it's a really annoying post anyway but maybe you guys can put up with it cause you will relate to it on some extent? I don't know, again, I will delete it if you tell me to

&gt;So, I am 17. I have severe anxiety which I think evolved into agoraphobia, I don't have a diagnosis because I have obviously never gone to a psychiatrist because mental health is a myth in my country (Romania, if you're curious). Also, depression and ocd probaly. I have always said I either have 7 disorders or one that's as bad as 7. I'm not self-diagnosing, just guessing because I have no other choice lol.  
&gt;  
&gt;Because of my mental health I just couldn't go to school since about november. Like, literally couldn't because my anxiety made me freeze in fear every time I thought about it. At first, it was online and i just stood there staring at the screen for hours not being able to just press the button to enter the meeting. I rarely could enter but just leaving it on and going into the other room to have my panic attack in peace. The fact that my romanian language teacher verbally abused me several times probably has something to do with it too. Then, when in-person school started, it was even worse. I never went to school but it was always on my mind. Never-stopping anxiety. I also only left the house once a month or so to go to the dentist or other doctor.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, I SOMEHOW was able to finish the year with grades from assignments to all the subjects, but, you guessed it, romanian, because the pos abusive teacher also refused to mark my assignments as done becasue I wasn't at school. Now, they're saying I have to go to school on tuesday to have some kind of oral evaluation WITH THAT TEACHER. I just straight up said I couldn't. I physically cannot make me walk there because I will have a huge panic attack and probably feel like I'm dying on the street. I cannot do it. It feels like making a sexual abuse survivor go back and be abused one more time (I am really sorry if this is disrespectful tu sexual abuse victims, but that's how it feels, you can't compare abuse).  
&gt;  
&gt;So, now my abusive parents (I can't even go into this subjects, they're horrible people and I'm pretty sure they're narcissists, though obviously I'm not a doctor) threaten me with kicking me out of the house because, in their words, ""you're so ungrateful, have you ever thought about all the sacrifices we've made for you (they literally did nothing, they barely even gave me food, made me ""work for it"" and with shelter, well we live in a ONE ROOM APARTMENT so yeah, not blaming them for this, but for being so entitled without even a base for it), we won't let you laugh in our face and abandon school, you will get out of our house if you do this"". So, I guess it had to happen eventually, they're also raging homo/transphobes and I am both gay and non-binary, and they would have definitely kicked me out if they found out, but I guess they found another reason to do it.  
&gt;  
&gt;So I really don't know what to do. My life savings amount to about 1 thousand dollars (again, Romania, they also kept my government allowance or whatever it's called), I have no family, no friends that could ever take me in, a mental state too fragile to ever get a job, so it really feels like the only option is dying. This is the end of the road for me. Not trying to be dramatic, though I am suicidal I never thought of actually doing it, but I see no way out of this situation. So, yeah, I really don't know what to do. I am really sorry if this is not appropriate for this sub, tell me where else to put it and I'll delete it from here if it's not. Also, sorry for the rant-y and victimizing tone, that's just me i guess lol. Thank you for reading this, even if you don't know what to say, it still means A LOT.

It's ironic how when we are going to attempt it, they stop us and and find ways to prevent it from happening when they don't even see what's the main problem of the entire situation. Society keeps letting it happen by pressuring us to the point where we can't handle it anymore and then wonder why we decided to commit suicide. They tell us not do it and try their best to prevent individuals from taking their own lives while they are forcing us into this situation. Come on, go solve the freaking problem or at least reduce it and not wait until the effects of it arises and stop us. 

Tl;dr: Instead of preventing suicide attempts, first solve the issue that leads us to being suicidal.",Sadme4life,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/od2ppf/society_is_a_failure/,suicide case across entire world still happening matter first society even care u totally first place ironic going attempt stop u find way prevent happening even see main problem entire situation society keep letting happen pressuring u point handle anymore wonder decided commit suicide tell u try best prevent individual taking life forcing u situation come go solve freaking problem least reduce wait effect arises stop u tl dr instead preventing suicide attempt first solve issue lead u suicidal,society failure,858,20

I almost don't feel anything,"Hi I wanted to say sorry for my bad English at first and secondly I don't have suicidal thought but it's very similar in a certain way.

# Context:

I'm a 21 years old guy who lives in Europe in a confortable coutry and I have parents that loves me a lot and no brother, sister or family. I'm an extrovert and I have depression (probably sever depression). I have passions (playing music, anime/manga, sports, judo, ...), I don't smoke anything or do drugs and I will never, I don't drink alcool and I will never too. And if it could help I'm an atheist.

# Relationships:

I have always had functional relationships that time has eroded. I have a best friend now even so I'm skeptical. I was the type to be friends with the whole class or the sports club, to quickly become friends with my kindness which people abused. Now I am no longer nice but I have found that socially things are going well even though I had fun doing a tour of all my social networks to find that my relationships are failing. I only have a friend and a few acquaintances whereas before that was not the case. The reason: I was traumatized and betrayed. I have been through tough things in relation to things, scams, people who have abused or harassed me when I had finally considered them as friends or even almost killed myself in cold blood. THE WORST is that it's total, I found something horrible that was done to me on almost every person. It saddens me and makes me lose hope in this principle that relations are becoming more and more arbitrary with social networks on top of that. After all that and all these lies and betrayals that I never experienced at such a young age, how can I believe that? Even my best friend, I don't give him that steadfast trust anymore because I just can't.

But it's not just on the point of friendship that I no longer trust and that I'm broken. On love I have not experienced anything directly but the little that I have seen, the experiences of my relatives and the discrepancy that there is between me and society (I am looking for seriousness only and lasting at 21 years old). and I want to build a functional long-term thing). Not to mention my paranoia which means that I will never trust anyone again. Let us add this to the deceptions, betrayals or even cases that people take as a couple. The responsibility versus the risk that it brings versus the few bonuses that it gives; make me say it's not worth it at all even though it was something I believed a lot.

# Traumas:

About the family I am happy to have parents who love me but they are seriously ill. My mother had a liver transplant and a coma in 2011, she has multiple sclerosis and in April 2021 she caught COVID-19 which almost killed her. On the other hand, my father is very old (63 years old), he is blind in one eye, has severe problems with his legs and lungs (from which his father died). I was inked in my head that they will die when I will be young and now that my mother has almost died it is inked. Especially since their condition worsens visibly. Of course, I didn't have any other family. From my father's side it's ultra negative and it went to justice (they had to kill me, threatened me, harassed and hit me) and my mother's side is rather neutral and classic (so that unnecessary formalities). I am touched by this, but now I become more and more apathetic in general about the suffering of others.

I was harassed in elementary school. IT'S VERY CLASSIC but seriously, it was violent. It was supposedly because I liked Pokémon. In reality it was because they thought I was gay over a misunderstanding and harassed me for it + I don't have big brothers to defend me. So daily fight, pugilla in the morning and in the evening almost KO. The teachers were there too. They ridiculed me and said of me (who was an HP) that I was a dark fool without coming over and over. It got inked in me to the point of making me completely lose confidence in myself. I was friends with my bully on top of that. Nothing was going even outside of school the reputation of being a Pokémon fan was spreading. In short, it still sticks to me this thing with Pikachu Pikachu.

During adolescence the bullying subsided but I was too nice and idle. People have taken advantage of me like never before. I was the nice and athletic geek so easy to become his friend to be friends with the others then the kicker of the group. It often happened like that but I spoke about relationships above.

One of the worst years of my life was 2018. I learned that a very good friend I had made had committed suicide and I missed my school year for the first time in my life. BUT the biggest event was the death of my cat. He only lived 6 years and we did everything to offer him a good life, calm and calm. But he died of a stroke because saliva was in his lungs. He died in excruciating pain and it was overnight and I hoped in vain to save him. I had a very close relationship with him, he was a full member of my family. But as I write this block I realized that maybe it was I who made the situation worse. My cat already had basic heart problems and like an idiot I decided to play with the laser with him for the first time (a month and dust before his death) and he got into it very intensely. I stopped but I noticed that he drooled. Basically I lost a loved one but I feel like I'm a little at fault and it destroys me. Nevertheless it was sudden and my cat did not do it again and for a month and a half everything was calm then from one night to the next he could not walk any more then the stroke occurred. Basically I know it's not me because I spoke to the vet and confirmed this to me, but the loss of my cat means that I have consequences. In 2018 I had suicidal tought, and I only wanted things to stop and be happy.

I had a very bad experience with the first confinement because I saw one of my passion get lost and full of illusions and my inocence that I was determined to keep disappearing. I lost loved ones, people betrayed me even more and I saw the state of a world and a society totally in shambles. I don't care about other people's happiness, I just want to be happy. IN ADDITION during this confinement I lost access to the internet completely so my days were devoted to total introspection and looking at the walls because I had nothing else to do literally.

# This year:

I was in a big depression from 2016 to 2018 until I discovered a game that got me out of it, Super Smash Bros Ultimate. I loved the E Sport competition on it and meeting its players. I wanted to live on it naively and confinement took that away from me and PAF we discover that the majority of players are pedophiles. I was disgusted and inflicted and I fell back into severe depression (because the confinement was hard). So I started studying but by constraint because I didn't have time to research because I was cut off from everything.

In addition, one of my best friends who now is just a lambda friend screwed me. I further realized that my relationship with him was despicable and toxic and that he helped make me believe that I was stupid and incompetent when I was very far from it. People also inked me that I was ugly as a tuna.

I managed to go beyond and finally find a passion: music. I have been playing the piano for 10 years but following complications I had to stop for 2 years. So I got into the guitar. And suddenly my goal was to make music for video games (the one that transcends me so much). As you can imagine regaining my confidence, having the wisdom gained from my experiences, a clean and healthy lifestyle and a goal. I was motivated to start other studies again next year. Could nothing go wrong?

My life is a huge joke. I literally chained one serious event per week from March to now. The almost death of my mom, the university which forgot to press the validate button and I had to call them 187 times (it's real), my piano finally bought at 1500 € which decides to no longer work (even if I finally fix it), the passions and cultural licenses that I love which just become null and void or which no longer correspond to me, realizing that my life is a total relational failure. Imagine having a day of constantly calling a university and telling yourself that you are going to play some music to rest and then the bug thing. Even if it is solved it is just insupportable. I also had problems with my online friends and found out that one I was close to (7-8 years of friendship) was a pedophile. In short, in just 3 months I went from the best, from the top to the bottom. I continued to eat clean, play sports and my passions but now I have a breakdown. I don't feel anything anymore, I have become more aggressive and colder. Life disgusts me and nothing is going and has never been in my direction. I'm just fed up with life and wish it would end, at least just be happy.

&amp;#x200B;

# In the end:

My goals and objectives, my future studies, the desire to have friends and keep my friends, the desire to be happy and to exercise my passions, ... Nothing is there anymore. I am empty, yes I am going to laugh sincerely or be slightly carried away by something but that will not go further. I talk about my problems around me but it's so futile. I see a psychiatrist but he is as useful as a wet sock. By just listening to me, telling me trivialities and telling me why not try the anti-depressants (which I refuse to take and I will not develop why). It's just without appeal. I no longer have hope and basically I don't want to have hope, hope is betrayal and a self-destructive mechanism. At 21, I'm already jaded like an 80-year-old. I had plans this summer, restaurants, trips, activities and even see a cat bar for example (because despite the death of my cat I still love animals). But these days I don't want to. I have commitments already made but I don't want to make them, I don't want to do anything. I have the impression that I would end my life alone in homelessness without anyone.

I am also someone who takes the lead so good. What good is studying next years in a vacuum, what good is continuing my musical project (which is based on the use of Discord this demonic software) or even playing or other.

I wanted to try my madeleine de prouste like an old game or anime but I don't have the motivation for it. I don't want nothing but I only want to be happy. I'm tired and the only think keeping me alive is the feer of death and and the will of life.

I don't have any hope left.,"I am almost 40 years old. I have nothing. Never been married , no kids. I live alone  in a one bedroom apartment. I don't have that much money and barely make ends meet. I am a high functioning Autistic and socializing is hard for me. I have no friends and people I think are my friends take advantage of me. I like my job and I am good at it and my coworkers come to me for help but it's mostly a deadens. 

In my early 30s, I got laid off twice in 3 years, a teenager hit my car  at a red light and lied and I got sued for 36,000 dollars. my brother who was my best friend died, my father got cancer and I had to move in with him because I lost everything I had. My mother had a stroke and I had to help care for her. This was all in about 4 years. 

I finally got an okay job a place of my own and a car but starting again at 40 is so much. I wastes so much of my life scaping by and there is nothing I can do now. 

I don't have any friends. No one talks to me they either ignore my messages or leave me on read until they need something and they know I am so lonely I will do it. I was just off of work for 2 weeks because I had to take a mandatory vacation because I hadn't taken a vacation in 3 years. And I sent messages to everybody I could for two weeks trying to get anybody to do anything with me and most people didn't even open them. Some did and not reply and very few said no and only one said yes but then cancel. 

I am alone all the time if not at work. I don't speak for days on the weekend. I often think about the fact that if I get hit and killed driving somewhere nobody we'll even know where I was going or what I was doing unless it was going to work. Work is Is the only place where my absence would even matter. 

I have been on dating apps and sites for years and have never got a actually match. Literally no one. I use to be okay and getting dates but one seems interested anymore. 

I had someone I thought it was my friend and I tried to tell her about this, she was not very helpful and then she just stopped talking to me. Every time I open up to people they pretty much abandon me so now I don't. Which is probably why this is so long. 

I gave myself one year try to fix my life last December and everything got worse I have no joy in life at all. I don't believe in any religion or the supernatural, everything seems so meaningless .

Close to suicide,"I am drunk. I have been lurking in this sub for a few days. I am drunk so I am telling the truth, you know, truth serum and all that. I am very close to suicide.

My best friend left me because of how I kept her on edge with my depression and suicidal thoughts,"Trying to be as honest as I can be. Basically my close friend and I have been friends for 3 years. And during those 3 years we were really close to each other. We were internet friends so we never met in real life. Basically over the past few months, I’ve been struggling with my depression and suicidal thoughts. And I used my friend as an outlet for those thoughts and she was my emotional support. I told her many times how I wanted to die and she was always on edge and under stress. I have severe needy and attachment issues. And she became a lot busier with her life and I became very depressed and suicidal. I kept on telling her these thoughts and she was always upset and on edge with me. I wasn’t taking her feelings into consideration and I was being selfish. I guilt tripped her and made her feel like she had to be with me in order for me not to kill my self. I should have been seeing a therapist but I was always busy with work and school. Now she finally had the last straw. She said that she can’t take it anymore and she blocked me on all social media’s and even deleted her Instagram. She’s gone just like that. My best friend is gone. I couldn’t cope with her being busier and now that she’s gone idk how I’m suppose to cope now. I’m so scared and afraid I don’t know what to do. I regret telling her all of those thoughts and making her feel on edge all the time. I wish I could say sorry and we could make up. I’m so sorry I’m so sorry. I was always afraid of taking my life cause I was afraid of the painful process. But like I don’t know what I’m gonna do now. I can’t reach out to her, she’s left me alone. I can’t talk or hang out with her anymore. I’m so desperate to not lose her I would do anything. I know that this isn’t healthy I know. I want to change and get better I want to. But I don’t know if I have the strength, especially since my friend is gone. She’s GONE. She was everything to me. I love her so much, I should have been a better friend. I lost her, I lost her. I want to die but I don’t like pain or blood. I don’t think I can live any longer, this painful feeling is so overwhelming. I’ve never experience this painful loss in my entire life.

"""Help"" is not possible anymore for lost cause","It's true. I am a lost cause. 

I am 29 years old and have been treated for depression since I was 14. Have been hospitalized for suicidal ideation 3 times (what a waste of time and money), am medicated but the drugs don't work...I've tried everything, and have done talk therapy. 

I'm now at a point (for the past year) where I've realized that there is no ""help"" to be had. I just want it to end. 

I wake up and think about death all day and wait to go back to sleep, but I sleep like shit. I hate doing everything. Every single thing that isn't sleeping, I hate it and feel like I'm crawling out of my skin. I haven't exercised due to that and am just getting fatter and uglier and feel even worse in the cycle knowing that it's my fault for not exercising and eating convenient cheap food and eating gluten when ik it makes me feel like shit but I just don't care, I just want to not be hungry. I don't even enjoy food, I just eat out of habit because I used to love it. Now I curse the world for having to eat and wish I could just not at all because it doesn't even make me happy anymore. Nothing does. No one does. 

I live with my boyfriend in my parents apartment above the garage and they just enable my shit habits and I feel so bad for doing this to them. For being a ghost of who I used to be. I don't engage. I avoid them. I avoid and isolate myself from all the other family and friends in my life. I'm so lucky to have them but I wish I didn't. I wish I had no one and could kill myself but even with them in my life I can't figure out a way to kill myself because I'm too stupid it don't have access to anything that will actually kill me.

"I lost my light, and I am lost with out it😇👿","I try to hold my self accountable, but then end up resentful/disappointed at myself for trusting somebody or having expectations. It has self me very bitter, nihilistic and worst of all extremely introverted. Which truly hurts me the most because I use to live to help people/laugh &amp; do all I could to make people happy. I have came to realize I basically hate myself and I showcase it by being spiteful at the very fabric of existing. I am not really depressed or anxious anymore, just numb &amp; quiet mentally I use to be so ambitious and resilient. I have quintessentially taken a sabbatical from existence to at least avoid spreading my misery/hatred. I got major trust issues, I am broken, lost and literally stuck. Trying to move forward is impossible I am destined to be incarcerated soon, my last 6 months and next 6 months are just FUBAR. I have done everything I have ever wanted to do for my self with in reason. Nothing brings me joy like being loved,appreciated, valued.
The people I cared about the most, all betrayed my trust when I needed them the most. I was over worked/overwhelmed trying help to my friends and family. I feel like the people I did everything for, would of died for, neglected myself by making time for them I should spent resting/relaxing. Couldn't give me any compassion, help, or even time of day to listen to me as my world feel apart. It really, really fucked me up more then anything.

Not many resources for chronic pain/illness,"I've been depressed for many years now. Tried both therapy and medication multiple times. Nothing ever really seems to help.
When I look for resources I rarely find anything geared toward my situation. A lot of help is geared toward people who have external factors like other people, their job, financial trouble. Or people who are dealing with mental stuff like anxiety, stress, loss of loved ones.


I know that even for people in those situations a lot of the usual advice is still fairly unhelpful/aggravating. Stuff like ""it gets better"" and ""you aren't in this alone"".


But for me a lot of the help out there isn't even accurate or helpful.
I'm actively working with doctors and taking medication for chronic conditions but am still in regular amounts of pain and discomfort. I have ulcerative colitis and am currently dealing with a fissure.


Long term my condition will only get worse, there is no cure. I turn 30 this year and have already had multiple colonoscopys and use a pill caddy.

My partner is having suicidal thoughts and suffering from a long depression. I need support/help/advice,"I have been with my bf for 11 years now. He is 28 going on 29. 

He has not worked since last March. He’s tried a few things but they have not worked out and that has made him progressively feel worse. He’s in the middle of another job not working out. He thinks it will but it’s not because he missed several deadlines. 

He’s had bad depression for a long time but will not get help and will not talk to me about it in any form. I only know because I monitor his search history because I was worried something was off and now I monitor it for when he searches suicidal things. 

He’s back to searching again. Many of the “I’m ready to be done” “I’m tired” and  things like that. In the not too distant past he has  written a suicide note that I found and I think this has been going on for years. I don’t mention it because I’m afraid he will just hide it even better and then I’ll never know. 

It’s honestly all too much for me and he is so unwilling to communicate with anyone I don’t know what to do. 

I know looking at his search isn’t good, but it’s how I feel I can keep him safer. 

His sleep is so messed up. He goes to sleep at 6-8am and sleeps all day and then takes more naps. It’s been like this for over a year now with his bed time getting later and later.

I also think I made him feel really bad two days ago. He refused to go do a pee test before they closed and it was the deadline for when he had to do it by for the job. I was upset and I said it hurt me that he wouldn’t do this simplest thing to ensure his job was secure when I’ve been working hard for the last year and a half and I just didn’t get how he couldn’t be willing to do the simplest thing.",treehugger503,8,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/od1v31/my_partner_is_having_suicidal_thoughts_and/,bf 11 year 28 going 29 ha worked since last march tried thing worked ha made progressively feel worse middle another job working think missed several deadline bad depression long time get help talk form know monitor search history wa worried something wa monitor search suicidal thing back searching many ready done tired thing like distant past ha written suicide note found think ha going year mention afraid hide even better never know honestly much unwilling communicate anyone know know looking search good feel keep safer sleep messed go sleep 6 8am sleep day take nap like year bed time getting later later also think made feel really bad two day ago refused go pee test closed wa deadline job wa upset said hurt simplest thing ensure job wa secure working hard last year half get willing simplest thing,partner suicidal thought suffering long depression need support help advice,1679,103

It really is an awful feeling.,"So, I'm 31 with a laundry list of mental illness. 3 weeks ago I was hit with a triple infection + outbreak. A week after that, bilateral inguinal hernia. Que laparoscopic surgery with mesh. Now I'm having financial issues as I'm out of work for 2 weeks. (Full time stock jockey at Walmart.)

My now ex fiancee of 8 years left me in November of last year and I found out from an old friend that she had cheated on me for the third time, but was too embarassed/ashamed/whatever to admit it. So, she faked mental illness (schizophrenia) and moved home to her parents. She took the dog too. Classic. My bad for actually loving her and trying to rectify what I should've realized was lost a long, long time ago.

4th of July is here and my family has once again, gone out of town to visit other family for the holidays. I wasn't invited and I never have been. My friends are all off with their own family or other friends.

And here I am, in a dark room crying my ass off posting on Reddit. I'm closer now to the edge than I've ever been. Nobody texts or messages unless I do so first. 

It's a lot to handle all at once and I can't help but feel that relief is only a trigger pull away.

I Have Always Hated It Here,"I fail to see any reason why I should keep on living. This is going to get dark. 

I hate it here. Always have. 

Most of my life has been nothing but anxiety, loathing, depression, insecurity, and this still lingers to this day. As a child, I was raised by a single mother after my father bounced and left us to fend for ourselves. I was abused by authority figures, raped, mugged, beaten, robbed, and seen some really bad things. 

As an adult, I have seen nothing but bullshit artists, abusive partners, neglectful boyfriends and girlfriends, and overall stupidity from these apes I have grown to despise: Humans. In fact, despised is too strong of a word. I remember when I finished seeing Avengers: Infinity War I was cheering for Thanos and felt sad at the end of the film; not because Thanos wiped out half the population, but that he didn't finish the job. 

Some may find humor in that statement, but I have gotten so far to the point of disgust that being around most others makes me feel nauseated and literally sick. I really want to end it all and I am certain that there is going to be little in the future that gets better.

And I hate the fact that society forces us to stay in a building that we wish to not be in. My body, my choice? yeah right! how come that does not apply to someone who wants to leave the world? Is not my life a part of my body? So, since it is my life, should I not be allowed to end it?

I want to be alone,"I wanna do all the things that are bad for me
I want to text the toxic boys that took pieces of my heart because all I feel worthy of is more shattering and brokenness 
I wanna be nude and provocative and gain strangers lust so I feel like for a moment the world loves me and knows who I am
I want to scream at the men who left me when I needed them most because now I trust no other man to not fail me when I’m at my weakest
I want to close up this pit of never ending love that I have in my body because all I do is spread it around like free pamphlets and people crumple it up and throw it away 
I want to run so far away and lie on a beach where I can slowly take my life in peace because I’m honestly not sure if I’m meant for this world. 26 years here and I highly doubt I’m meant for this world 
I want the sand to claim me and cover my feet, as the waves brush against me gently, understanding my pain, understanding that I need to leave, and holding my body close as I’m one with the earth the only thing that’s pure to me. The only thing that’s never betrayed me. I want my dad, the ocean, to hold my hands as I let go and fall into the unknown.
But this is only a dream. Only a fantasy I have every night. The comfort it brings me knowing that I can choose death at any corner let’s my heart rest as I close my eyes. 
I feel like I have too much to give, and there’s too little willing to receive. I feel like I give my entire heart to people who use it as a crutch until they move along. And I’m sitting with a broken and bruised heart, in the dark, stitching back pieces and rubbing on ointment, because no one will ever do that for me. 
26 years 
Most of it abuse 
How do you expect me to carry on. How can you look at the movie reel of my life and expect a solid outcome
26 years of being shattered, and so many of the pieces are locked out of mind, I can’t even find them to put them back 
I’m told to be strong at every corner I meet, as I watch people be strong for each other. As I have been strong for others. When is my turn to have a crutch? When does someone get to be strong for me? And that is why I picture myself on the beach, slipping away quietly. Alone.

Where I am.,"Today is July 3, 2021. 

I feel like there is a guillotine with a frayed rope positioned over my neck and I have until July 12 to avoid my own death. 

By July 12 I need to have:
1. Collected $600 to pay the attorney who is representing me at my divorce decree modification hearing. 

2. Completed a parenting class as required by the state of Texas. 

3. A place to do the mediation and the hearing to keep up the guise that I am not habituating in my vehicle. 

I can’t move on from this. I have to sit and listen to some judge decide my life, while in the same “room” as people who have a strong desire to destroy me. 

But I also am not going to be able to do any of those things. I’m not going to be able to make the $600, complete that parenting class or find somewhere to keep up that guise. 

What happens when I don’t? I don’t really know. My lawyer refuses to represent me first probably. I lose my son, which is going to happen anyway because I use cannabis, and cannabis + Texas= bad outcome. I’m found to be in contempt of court and face jail time. 

Why wouldn’t I if the stakes are so high? Because I can’t. I can’t make myself anymore. I can’t make myself work. I can’t make myself pay attention. I can’t make myself be productive anymore. It’s mentally and physically impossible. Between my suspected ASD and diagnosed depression, anxiety, and ADHD, I just can’t. 

I would rather die than go through all of this. There is no light at the end of this tunnel. I am clearly a worthless waste of space and I should just end it.

Disgusted,I hate how I look. I know I'm fat you and your friends don't have to call me fat my doctor does that for you. I've tried to fix it I went to the gym for months it didn't work. I tried dieting didn't work. I tried going on walks and runs didn't work. I'm still fat no matter what I do. I look in the mirror and I grab my fat and wish I could cut it off. I always suck in my stomach when I'm in public and at home. I grab the skin on my face and pull it tight to see what I could be if I actually tried harder. I've even tried starving myself but that doesn't matter because then I just snack most of the night those nights make me think how disgusting I am to eat like this. I think of how I'm being a pig or how no one will love me because of that gross habit. I started to cut myself because I realized that I'm not like other girls my legs fill a whole chair when I sit or how my stomach sticks out a lot more then there's or when I was looking back on prom pictures I wondered why does my upper arm looks like that but hers doesnt. I always see how people fat shame and say it's not healthy being fat but the thing is I know that I know it's not healthy I know it's not cute I know you and your friends call me a whale when I walk by I don't want to be fat I never asked to be fat. My dad said I don't even look how like much I weigh but it's strangers that I see on the internet that make me hate how I look that make me want to kill myself because way more people that think I'm gross then there are that make me feel good to be myself.

Something came over me last year for no reason, I got up opened the door and just walked out. At the time I didn’t even know what I was doing, I sorta switched to autopilot. I went to this field that had a metal railing surrounding it followed by a sheer drop. I wasn’t the first one to try someone 6 months prior did the same, flowers and other items where by the site but I was a little further down so I didn’t see it at the time. I looked down and looked at the sea smashing against the rocks, then the glare of the moon and looked up. A sense of fear passed over me and I felt the soft grass under my shoes as I leapt back over the railing. It was then I realised I’d tried to take my own life.


Now aside from the end part which sound weird ik, I’m seriously having thoughts about it now, thinking about how much better things were. Like hell if I knew my life would get as shit as it had I don’t know what I’d do. I get thoughts like this late at night sometimes and they make me deeply regret every decision that’s lead me to this point. Sometimes I think even a fresh start somewhere new wouldn’t even work.

Being 25 makes me want to kill myself. I'm a failure at life.,"Summary:

* I failed high school
* Got bullied enough I changed schools
* Push by my mother to drop out, emotionally abused for wanting to change schools
* Counsellors regularly stepped
* Went on a high school exchange overseas and got grounded by my host family
* Wanted to kill myself. My family didn't believe me, cut off medication, had a counsellor step in.
* The counsellor asked my dad to come to support me at my education institution for the day because I was planning on killing myself. He didn't believe me, came, told a family friend why he was there and left early after a few hours.
* Failed a university preparation course
* Kicked out of a university club 4 times
* At one point a lecture was cancelled so I can be taken to the hospital
* Was made to start 2 degrees I didn't want to do by my family
* Emotionally abused by my family
* Cheated my way through the first year of a Computer Science degree and focused way more on a public speaking conference I organised
* Dropped out
* Spiralled into a depression on welfare
* Cut off my family
* Picked up a grocery store job
* Sucked at it (disorganised, kept talking to myself, depressed, kept breaking stuff)
* Started working towards degree again. Haven't even been motivated to try because I cheated my way through the first year.

I feel like a fuck-up. A failure. A loser. Behind in life. Whatever.

Seeing a psychiatrist. My case was complex so the private psychiatrist was unsure what to do and said I need regular treatment with someone I can see in person. This one was online.

They sent a stimulant my way for ADHD which I'm getting on Wednesday but every psychiatrist I've seen is just very confused.

I think I have Aspergers, ADHD, and Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. I relate to them anyway. The private psychiatrist didn't diagnose me but said ADHD is likely.

I hope this stimulant is actually helpful in some way. I'm 25. Pretty much a NEET. Living at home. Failed at high school, university, and employment.

I'm pretty close to committing suicide. I feel so defeated and behind in life, it isn't even worth bothering.

Goodbye. Again.,"Back in October of 2020 I wrote my note here, on a separate account, but I never fulfilled that prophecy. But here I am again, it's July of 2021 when I'm writing this, only almost a year later. There's a lot of things in my life right now that are unstable. I'm too tired to work, and am broke beyond repair. It doesn't help that whenever I'm manic all that money that I still don't have still diminishes. I'm too angry to talk to my boyfriend. To any of my friends. I shut down too quickly, and I can't help but just have them look at me while I don't speak about my feelings. I've considered sabotaging my relationship with my boyfriend just so he wouldn't have to see me die. I'm a monster to someone close to him, and now I think they're right. I think they've always been right. I just thought that maybe I could fix it, but I can't. I don't know why it took me so long. I am the monster in everyone's life. 

I mean, I never saw a reason for living. In fact, I think about death more than I think about life. I think maybe to some people that would be terrifying, right? But it's so normal now. I used to think death was scary, that it was uncontrollable and the unknown was horrible, but I realized that that's exactly what life is. Uncontrollable and unknown.  

I'm tired of this. I'm tired of living. I'm tired of breathing when all I can think about is how much everyone hates me, how I would be better off dead anyway. This is all stupid. No one loves me, no one ever did love me. I'm replaceable. You'll forget I wrote this in a month.

I can’t live like this. Not with the guilt nor anything else,"Lost my Ivy League college offer and my best friend after school suspended me for sexual misconduct. It was for my first relationship, my first kiss, my first time having sex or anything else. I thought I was in love.

Always considered myself a feminist and grew up hearing awful stories from friends who were SA survivors. I thought being good to others was the only thing that truly mattered. But on our third date, after we had been having phone sex and experimenting with BDSM, when things got heated I went too far, and touched her a few seconds more after she said we should cool down. We kept dating and I grew much more focused on being aware of consent, but she grew distant. It fucked with me how she told me later how much she enjoyed it even though she was scared. But I’ve realized that’s classic survivor behavior, and she was just emotionally messed up from what I did. 

Right before graduation, when I started dating my current girlfriend, she filed a complaint and the police opened an investigation. I was suspended. My parents are inconsolable. 

I can’t live like this anymore. It all feels like it’s happening in the third person. I was 17 and on top of the world and now its all hopeless. Sometimes I think I’m worthless and committed the worst kind of crime you can commit. Sometimes I try to justify it all to myself and I get bitter. Either way my community, my friends, and my future employers will revile me. Nobody ever looks at you the same way after this kind of thing, no matter the amount of apologizing that you do.

I'll start off by mentioning I do have a therapist and haven't mentioned this to her yet- I'm writing here to start to piece together my thoughts first. 

I think for me it's partially a lack of reason/purpose. I'm at a point where I'm not incredibly depressed. I've been much worse- yet somehow I feel like I have to commit because I don't have a future. I've never had much motivation for anything, intrinsic or otherwise.

"I don’t care, though I wish I did.","I haven’t been in ‘good’ health in a long time. Not even close to functional. 

I’m dropping weight because I’m not eating; probably 10 pounds within the last couple weeks. I’m sitting at 126/127— I should be up around a buck 50. 

I have no interest to eat. No appetite. Nothing is really pushing me foreword. I used to wish I did have some spark, maybe I do a little bit.

Spent years and years and years battling this treatment resistant depression bullshit.

I feel like my entire body is just being drained for every resource it has. And I’m struggling to care about trying to fix it. 

Part of me thinks, ‘maybe this’ll get better’. But I’m tired. 

Tired and empty. 

One of the hardest things has just been trying to manifest reasons to continue with how much pain I’ve been in. 

I have no one to talk to (not that I’m saying that In search of pity...I pushed them all away in being too sick). I really wish I could just be your average person, someone who didn’t have to be aware of how horrible things are each day. Waking up is excruciating, because I hate being trapped in my head. When the reality hits you a couple seconds into waking, it immediately blankets me in this cloud of hopelessness. 

Nothing about being here is enjoyable. It hasn’t been for many many years—maybe 10.  

I gave up on being ‘happy’, happy in the way that I’ve always imagined in my head. How I was at one point. I don’t think that shit is ever coming back. And that’s alright, there’s really nothing I can do about it. 

I don’t know why I’m writing this. Possible to vent before leaving. I don’t really know anymore. 

I do wish I could experience that same happiness I had as a teenager, whatever that was.

Feels as though it’s just a really bad roll of the dice.

My country makes me suicidal,"I don't believe that many of you here will understand me since you feel that USA is the worst place to live in but you can't realize how lucky you may are. I live in eastern Europe, to a country that is considered developed but it's not.

Mental health it's still a taboo, psychiatrists and psychologists are not well trained and very expensive, most of them just give you a bunch of pills there is no one to know erp for ocd, dbt for bpd etc. We have extremely economical issues, you can't find job anywhere, not even to a fast food and school s are crap the same goes with universities also. People here are extremely religious and superstitious and they can't understand how detrimental is that for someone with ocd.

I destroyed myself for a useless degree because education system is so complex and stupid and because I never found proper therapy, I had only unhelpful medication. I feel doomed being here and trapped because I can't find anyone to understand me.

I'm not delusional I don't think that my problems would dissappear if I lived somewhere else but I know for sure that situation here makes everything worse, makes me feel more isolated and anxious. I feel better when I spent time on reddit because I can find people who have the same thoughts but then they suggest me something that I can't apply here or a great advice that I can't follow because I live here.

I have tried many times to explain in too many subs my problems but people seem to not understand my situation and it's logical, they can't even imagine how awful things are here. They take some things for granted when they are not here unfortunately.

My fears with social anxiety and ocd may seem objectivly irrational to most but they are completely rational considering my life. I live in a small town and everyone knows everyone, most people who have mental health problems they hide it to the point to be extremely careful to even visit their doctor. You must always have a good reputation in order to be a part of the society, if your neighbors hear you crying or screaming, you have been destroyed whole town will consider you mentally retired.

I tried many times to share my thoughts in a local mental health forum but most people were so damaged to offer me a meaningful advice or they just told me to take medicines like this is the golden solution fir everything. Some of them they became extremely religious and they can't see any other solution. I don't judge them, it seems the only way to cope here with our situation.

I can also go on and on about how corrupted our whole system are and how people use fake excuses to take allowances and other gifts etc but there is no point. Nobody can understand how its to be here except for someone who lives in one of those countries or in a Balkan country.

I can't live like this anymore and I know there is no point to try to get better because my life will be crap either way. I used to believe that my problem is just mine, I have a different way of thinking not very similar to my culture and the way of living here but I realize that you must be delusional to feel good here.

I'm sure that other people here feel the same way but they just try to ignore it or they just have faith in God.

I don't want to die really but I think I have to. Not because of my country, I have many other reasons but there is no solution here. The only good thing is that when I will fall from the balcony, I won't be saved because hospitals here are so inefficient. I knew someone in my age who fell from much lower high and he still ended up dead when I have read for people who jumbed from much higher place and they lived probably because medical stuff reacted quickly.

"I love how I have passive depression and suicidal ideation everyday, but won't actually commit","I hate the fact that I have depression and suicidal ideation. Literally, it varies on how the day is going that my depression will either spike into suicidal thoughts or if it'll mean that I'll just hate myself.
I was diagnosed with depressive mood disorder in the hospital along with some other things and it doesn't help that my life is pretty shit compared to my friends, even though we are all going through our own problems. I can never see the positive side of life, I feel that I'm wasting time and my family's time and money. I can barely pass my college classes, I'm getting interrogated about my financial spending even though I was taught to budget. I feel that my parent doesn't like me that much anymore, especially after a situation that we went through in 2020, because they had a really bad seizure that cause a psychological break. Which was just great. Ever since that event, I feel like our relationship has just gotten worse and worse. And I feel like giving up honestly. I hate talking to people about my problems because I tell them the same thing everytime, ""You can't help me, so why help me?"" 
The whole time I've been with my parent it's been up and down. Some days they're loving, but most days they come off like they hate me or are disappointed in something that I've done. Although I've tried to do everything right. Nothing is apparently working. And when they talked to their spouse, it's almost like they love them more than me. And I don't understand what I'm doing wrong. Don't get me wrong, I love my parent to death and will do anything for them, but it's really making sad and I'm trying my best to hide my emotions and I'm starting to develop apathy towards the entire situation. 
And that's where the depression and suicidal thoughts linger. My depression is passive, but when something bad happens that can be fixed or if there's an altercation, my depression just plummets and I start feeling suicidal. I try not to come suicidal because then I would have to talk to my parents about it and it's no point because they'll tell me that there's nothing to be sad, angry, or depressed about. Which makes me feel worse and then I just give up and say that there's nothing wrong and try to walk away from the situation. 
Ever since 2020, I feel like I can’t talk to my parent the same way like we used to and on top of that, I'm struggling in college and they're threatening to take me to a military recruiter even though I can't join because psychological reasons. And all of this is causing me really bad depression and causing me to feel suicidal almost everyday, but it's passive like I said. So I don't know what to do.
I usually don't come on here and talk about shit that's wrong with me. I don't care about this post going on trending or getting any awards.

I tried to kill myself when i was 8,"So my parents had divorced when i was 6 and it force my mom to move little bit too far from my father.

And one day when she was yelling and yelling to my sister and I, I just decided to end it and went in my room to kill myself. I grabbed a scarf that I had found in the woods and tied it to my neck and in to my closet handle. I was in this kinda kneeling position first (i guess) that then switched into a straing sitting position where my butt was in the air but my heels were on the ground. I dont know how long I was there but the last thing i remember was looking at my hockey teams team picture where i was sitting next to my best friend (we still are best friends) and i look at him in the face and said in my mind ""goodbye"". But then luckily my sister my very dear sister stopped me and rescued me from there and called my mother to help. I woke up and started crying hard.

I haven' t talked about this to anyone outside my mother and my sister. Even my father doesnt know what had happened to this day. Im kinda embarrised about it so thats probebly the reason i havent talk about it to anyone. im crying and other shit right now so i dont cara about grammar and i hope this was the right place to open up.

&amp;#x200B;

E: i havent tried to kill myself since, but i still have light toughts of shooting my self in the head atleast once in a week. But I know im not going to do it since it ist the right option and because i have people in my life that would be broken if id leave forever

I used to be so good,"I am not sure about the rules but **trigger warning** 



I'm 30 now, I used to work 14-16 hours a day either on my job, or trying to start a business, in 2017 the business was going well and I decided to take a break after working for so long, initially it was supposed to be a month, it turned into 6, it turned into 3 years. Now that I have do much free time I started to think about my past and why do I feel down most of the time, but I couldn't remember a lot of stuff and was started to get depressed and reached out to therapist, within a few sessions she asked me about my childhood and few sessions in I realized I had been sexually abused by family members and sexually assaulted by someone at school, both memories I had completely blocked from my memory, shortly after that the therapist suggested that I need to step away from family and my abuser and people who took advantage of my new situation of having comfortable financial situation.

I wasn't ready yet, I was scared I wouldn't be loved or accepted by anyone else, so I stayed, and my feelings are getting worse everyday, I started to have sex (before I was waiting for marriage, and having sex makes me feel guilty), started to pay for sex, even got paid to fuck a gay guy, I am getting fat, I got more depressed, started to have intrusive thoughts, thinking about hurting myself, thinking about taking drugs, or self harm, suicide.

The love of my life married someone else because family didn't approve on marrying her, and she blocked me and got engaged/married to someone else, started to have feelings towards a hooker that later broke up with me and got engaged to someone else as well. Couple of years after that I saw my first love by chance, she saw me and looked away, so I walked away crying, few days later she called me, said she is not happy, we meet few times then had sex (we never did before), I feel horrible for making her cheat on her husband, never thought I would sleep with a married woman so I feel super guilty about that as well, but we still talk every few days, and I am still trying to fuck her but she keeps rejecting me, yet are is sad whenever I tell her that I might go on a date with someone.

I am scared of getting married, I will either cheat because I am addicted to sex, or she will cheat on my like my gfs before her, or that my child will be abused like I was, or that I won't be a good father like my dad.

I am afraid to go back to work because maybe I am not as good as I was, I don't want to take new risks or get out my comfort zone.

I tried to get a residence in a different country and leave family and memories behind, made as much research as possible but I always back down and find excuses of why that is the right thing to do.

I'm just tired, tired of the self harm, suicidal, intrusive thoughts, tired of being scared to move out, tired from staying home all day everyday, tired of people trying to take advantage of me, tired of lack of trying, tired of how bad and fast I have changed, tired of it all.

Now, even my business, the one thing I was proud of, the what feels like my only achievement is falling apart, and I am unable to do anything to try to fix it.

Life is meaningless,In the past year I tried to kill myself 5 times and failed. The last time I was at the hospital was two weeks ago. I want to stop hurting but suicidal thoughts don’t go away. I want to go to med school but my application is a joke and I’m barely prepared for the entrance exam. My work thinks I’m a horrible employee (which I am). Being at home with my family is really triggering but I can’t survive on my own. I’m dropping out of school and don’t know what to do with my life. I lost my meaning of life. I’m a disappointment to my family. But most of all I can’t stand myself. I’d rather die than live life as myself. Every word I say makes me cringe and I can’t look at myself in the mirror.

I’ve made the decision it’s now when… Any Christians feeling this way aswell?… (Also non-believers),"I’ve got no option now to do something. I can’t be here anymore. 
I think the best option for me is to jump. 
It would have to be really early when there is no people around.
I’ve given life a go and it let me down. 
I don’t want to be here.
Bad things happen to me all the time and I’m sick of it. I just wanted a simple life. 
I asked and prayed to God but no answer and nothing. 
I keep getting attacked by bad forces and I’m sick of it. BTW - I used to be very happy most of the time. I used to pray all the time and read my bible. I also used to workship and praise regularly aswell…so I wasn’t a lukewarm Christian, I also acknowledged Christ/God.
I didn’t watch Joel Osteen, Bethel or Hillsong, I used to watch the ones that were strictly bible preaching and end times stuff. 

This past year has been utter hell for me and I can’t be here anymore. As time goes on it’s becoming unbearable. 

Having my faith is my life and now it’s been taken away from me. I can’t be here anymore. 

I wish for someone to take me away or hopefully I’ll actually push through and do it myself. 

I gave life a go and it let me down…

"I made my peace, and it was stolen from me.","Three years ago, a tornado came very close to my old apartment. It was the most terrifying experience of my life, but the next day, I woke up wishing I had died.

My mom just told me that she feels safer with my 15 year old sister driving than with me (I’m 25).,"I do not have my driver license, been to afraid for years, and it has been very restrictive and limiting on my life. My parents have told me NUMEROUS TIMES, that I would be unable to move out and live on my own if I don’t have a driver license and a car.

I would talk about how I was SO RELIEVED that self driving cars were being developed and tested. I still do support them (and they’re still probably 5-10+ years away from consumer access, let alone going mainstream) even when I feel I might manage to pass my driving test and drive on my own everyday.

I didn’t even properly conquer my fear of driving. I just decided that with how limiting not driving is, my life isn’t worth being so protective over, so the benefits of driving outweigh the risks of dying in a car accident. Surviving, but in a vegetative state of paralysis, WOULD NOT be worth it, but still seems not worth worrying about to the point of refusing to drive.

While I simply stopped caring about the fatal dangers of driving, I did improve A LOT. Written portion of the test was easier than ANY school test I’ve EVER taken.

But, it seems even after the bizarre urges to do dangerous things such as floor and brake, jerk the wheel, have long since disappeared, it seems I STILL LACK CONTROL, EVEN WITHOUT IMPULSES, EVEN WITH GENUINELY TRYING MY BEST, it seems I STILL can’t control myself/the car very well.

I can’t stay completely in the lane, I drift to close to the curb because I’m trying to ensure I’m not close enough to the opposite lane, so I avoid any head on collisions, and parallel parking makes no sense direction wise (this is actually WELL KNOWN to cause new drivers to fail the test, but most still get it at least after a few attempts).

I lose sense of direction having to control the vehicle while going backwards, because left and right now mean right and left and keep switching.

My mom is too terrified to be in the car with me, my dad is an abusive closed minded jackass, and my stepdad who drives big trucks for a living can be a jackass too but even he said I made him “scared” when I was driving.

And because I “almost drove into the garage wall”, behind my back he said “well his sister may not even be old enough to drive she’s actually NORMAL”.

This mofo has tried to force me to drive, even threatening to charge me more rent if I just use Uber, and now “he’s scared” of me driving.

Why not just continue taking Uber and trying to get a better job that doesn’t require driving as part of the job? Well, without a proper past high school education, any decent paying real job requires driving as part of the job, like the trades. Constantly taking Uber won’t cut it. Real estate agent? “Nobody wants to buy from an agent who’s going house to house in an Uber”. Also that does require heavy social skills…… makes me shudder.

I’m stuck as a goddamn grocery bagger/cart pusher. I do a lot of physical labor, often 40 hours a week, and don’t make even $1,600 a month. I have to follow these STUPID scripts BY THE LETTER or get a nasty look and written up.

I feel less than human, just some emotionless, no personality robotic shell zombie.

I’m losing my parents health insurance by the end of this year, the SSRI withdrawal is going to be a fate worse than death. Life isn’t worth fighting for, I don’t give a fucking shit about competing.

Even if I was somehow able to work from home, live in a big city with mass transit/walkability, and the PERFECT FOR ME WOMAN appeared, I don’t think I’m capable of being in a relationship, I have too much baggage and damage, I don’t think I have the capacity or emotional availability at this point. If the SSRI withdrawal gives me permanent sexual dysfunction and complete emotional numbness, I’ll be better off. But I’m BEST OFF DEAD, either way.

I’m 25 and still nowhere near being able to function on my own, I shouldn’t even be ENTERTAINING THE IDEA of having a girlfriend. I need a lobotomy and castration. But again, best off dead, either way.

I hate this BS society, I’ve never fit into it, I may have less bizarre impulses as I grew older, but I still have absolutely no social or life understanding.

My mom, who has panic attacks and refuse to be in the car with me driving, now lets my 15 YEAR OLD SISTER, who’s she CONSTANTLY MAD AT for doing drugs, sneaking out, and hiding guys in the house.

Step dad who’s “the master at driving” and it’s his LITERAL LIVELIHOOD, is even scared of my driving. Last time he yelled and it triggered my anger and PTSD, I can’t deal with this shit called “being an adult”.

I don’t understand how it comes naturally to most people, even to those younger than me, which proves, that it’s obviously not strictly an age thing. 

I want to swallow my entire 12,000+ MG of Sertraline and hopefully die from the serotonin syndrome, but my prescription is closer to empty and the fucking pharmacy closed and won’t be open tomorrow either.

I wanted to go before I was supposed to work at that place again tomorrow. Let the assholes get pissed off that I quit showing up because they like to schedule me to clear an entire parking lot all by myself for 8 hours straight.

Fuck this society, can even be denied pills because “can’t afford them without insurance” and the fucking police and asshole staff in mental hospitals can physically force you to stay alive, AND THEN give you a bill that can put you in lifelong debt.

Maybe I can get the police to shoot me, but I’m afraid it won’t even kill me. Police work 24/7, I wouldn’t have to wait until “pharmacy hours” reopen 2 days from now. But I’m doubtful they’ll shoot me fatally, and then force me into a mental hospital if not prison where I’ll get m fucking ass raped and locked in solitary probably through forced med withdrawal.

What options do I have at this point? I’m too selfish and impatient to be a wageslave for 40+ years while waiting for investments to grow and “unlock that 401K/Roth IRA”, I don’t care about that shit, the thought of living that much longer is unbearable and what’s the point if I have to waste my entire life away to POSSIBLY “enjoy life” in the last few years of my life?

Nobody gets it because they’re living a life worth living even during their youth, so they can’t relate to the mindset.

Going to lose my virginity to an escort before killing myself doesn’t even seem worth it. If I’m about to be dead, why bother doing anything before I die? Besides, I could arrested in a “sting” operation because even if it’s “consensual adults” sex is a crime if you pay for it. Unless I go to Nevada, but like I said, when I die I’ll be dead and nothing will matter anymore anyway.

"Had a psychotic episode, was already suffering from depression, now feeling worse than ever","I've gone through too much and done too much to really ever recover but this really tipped the scales into a realm of pure darkness. I was diagnosed with ADHD so trialled dexamphetamines courtesy of a psych for two months but they ended up triggering a psychotic manic episode of sorts, maybe due to combined daily weed usage as well, but especially when the guy I was casually seeing for 6 months broke things off with me, as well as getting into a stressful situation with my best friend at the time. The episode lasted 6 months though it felt like time flew past me, so much happened during that time: I cut off the aforementioned people, had them call the cops on me because of the state I was in, deleted a bunch of people off my facebook, told people I was a psychic medium, thought I was talking to spirits and living people through a psychic link, crashed my car at 90kmh yet was miraculously unharmed, had my mother say I was possessed by demons and sprayed me in the face with a shower head, was flown to a mental health facility 4 hours away and spent a week there, lost my pet rat to illness and was so mentally ill myself that I wasn't taking care of her or spending time with her in her last months, had my mother and others raid my room - breaking things, reading private journals and throwing away stuff in the process, spent a month (including my birthday) at a friend's parent's house - haven't hung out with the friend in years since his girlfriend doesn't like that we slept together years ago, spent all my savings on overpriced crystal jewelry and dumb crap, got stuck thinking about all my past mistakes and people that I've lost over the years because of my own selfish recklessness and ""I could die any day"" attitude, told my very loving father to ""fuck off"" for the first (and only) time in my life, also had father tell me not to call him ""daddy"" and say ""who are you trying to con now?"" about something I said/did, had mother say ""you want to live, you're the sperm that won"" plus coming at me for a personality disorder I haven't been diagnosed with and calling me toxic to the family, had my little sister call the cops on me for my erratic behaviour, have been kicked out of the family home and currently living with my nana, although that might change soon and I don't know if I want it to. 

I have so much anger towards my mother and how she's treated me my whole life, since she has anger issues and would always yell and scream about the smallest things, stomping around the house yelling about how I'm a ""useless, lazy cunt"" and other things over the years. She also smokes weed and I used to be so avidly against it since I realised as a young child and was scared that my sister and I would be taken away from her/lose her to getting arrested but when I found out my first boyfriend was a smoker when I was 17 I begrudgingly joined the bandwagon with him and his friends back in 2014-2015. This caused problems in our relationship, plus other things, and I ended up cheating on him with his best friend in a whole mess that dragged on until 2016, when he broke up with me and his best friend ended up ghosting me... I went off rails, ended up smoking more and more, trialled mood stabilisers and got drunk at a party then ended up sleeping with a friends boyfriend so was kicked out of that friendship group. Ex-boyfriend and that friend ended up dating which was a huge stab to the heart, but I never blamed either of them for not wanting me in their lives after everything I did wrong, although my ex stayed close with his best friend and my ex-friend stayed with her boyfriend for a year after he cheated while I was no longer welcome in the group. This made me feel like extra trash in comparison since they kept the other offending people in their lives while I was kicked to the curb; thankfully I had my best friend and her boyfriend, still, even dated the both of them in 2017 but that failed and I was kicked out of their house for continuing to smoke weed, day in and day out. These are the same two people that I lost during my psychotic episode that started at the end of last year and only ended a couple months ago, since then I've felt like my brain is broken like my thoughts do not form the same and I am no longer the actually fun person I was before. I haven't smoked for a couple months, either, though I kept smoking through the episode because it was already too late and I'd fucked everything up and lost all that I held dear. I spend every day now sleeping for as long as possible, until about 2-4pm, then drag myself to work until 11pm and just watch TV like a vegetable while I try not to cry... which fails since I cry every damn day since regaining sanity. I've read that some people never recover, mentally, from such an episode as it causes actual brain damage which has left me feeling devastated because I just want to go back to the way things used to be, as I would see my best friend 2-3 times a week and also the guy I had been crushing on for 3 years, her now ex-boyfriend, but obviously none of that will ever be the same... I was so happy that he finally asked to see me, even casually, after years of hoping for another chance after the failed polyamory attempt of 2017 but now he's living with some other chick who's his new best friend, while my best friend has moved into a new house with her other boyfriend, so even that dynamic has changed after 7-8 years of knowing them, and them being together. I'm grateful they've both been talking to me a little bit but it's a drastic change from seeing them every week since I was 16, even having lived with them twice before... not to mention my brain flinging me back to 2014-2015, the only time I had a serious relationship and wishing I could go back that far in time, not just back to before this mental breakdown destroyed my friendship, family and actual brain. 

It's extremely difficult to see a bright future ahead when each year things have gotten worse for me, especially with physical brain damage in the mix. I may be able to recover but the opposite is also true so I'm finding it extremely hard to want to be alive... I've told my father that I don't want to live and him saying that, if I died, he would too if making me feel forced to live... I don't want to destroy my family but my existence is honestly barely worth living and it's practically impossible to recover from the emotional and mental abuse my mother has dealt me, especially since she doesn't see her issues as anything that would have majorly impacted me, even though any personality disorder I may have could greatly be linked to the way she's treated me. 

I just want to reconcile those negative feelings towards my mother, since she tries to be loving, but she's also very controlling and won't even let me eat in my bedroom anymore or let the dogs inside, so if I do move back in it will honestly feel worse than before. Not to mention the majority of my property is now stored at my uncles in tubs that she organised so I don't even know where any of my stuff is which leaves me feeling angry and annoyed and upset constantly with her. Plus again the aforementioned invasion of my private journals and property including kink items that I'm not at all comfortable with her or my father having seen. It's hard to not feel responsible though since that invasion of privacy wouldn't have happened if I hadn't suffered a mental breakdown, same with the sudden rules of not eating in bedrooms or having the dogs inside, which affects my sister negatively as well. 

I'm thinking that if I save up $10 000 then send half to mum, half to dad, then leave my property for my sister I can just kill myself and be done with it even though I know they'd much rather have me alive, I'm sick to death of crying all the time and thinking about how great life used to be and how fucked in the head I am because of genetics/upbringing/past experiences, not to mention the loneliness of having lost my best friends. The loss of brain function after having a meltdown is, of course, the worst of it, plus being unable to ever touch weed again, as it had grown on me over the years, although it was definitely an addiction I should have fixed long ago. Just something I used to numb the pain of fucking up back in 2016, plus my best friends also smoked so was easy to do socially, even though I lost social contact with people who didn't smoke since I was constantly high and couldn't go more than a couple hours without smoking... didn't have my much of a job back then, would even smoke before work and on break, now it's gone forever. Which is probably for the best anyway but to lose the option entirely, not to mention the only way to actually treat ADHD, which I still have, and I'm feeling awfully unrepeatable for the mental shit I was already dealing with.

If you've made it through this wall of text, just know that I appreciate the time you've spent. I looked up this sub and, at the same time, received a text from one of my mum's friend's who is a psychic medium (hence where that delusion came from, I know another lady who is another friend of my mums and a medium I have seen for years with amazingly accurate advice, I'm normally more practical/sceptical but have had enough proof to believe in such things) which is always interesting... maybe I just wanted to feel special, I definitely didn't want to feel so lonely anymore, that's for sure, and if spirits actually wanted to talk to me I was overjoyed. But the lack of brain functioning really emphasises that I had a mental breakdown, even with physical evidence to tell me otherwise on some fronts, it was really hard to rip myself away from some delusions when they had some merit to them... I just wish it hadn't happened, as I was barely clinging to my will to live and dearly miss what I used to have with my friends in my life. And wish I didn't go through the extra trauma my mother provided, she didn't handle the situation well and neither did my father, really, but nobody really had experience with psychosis and I really wasn't helping myself at the time, either.",Twijinx,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/od4mxy/had_a_psychotic_episode_was_already_suffering/,gone much done much really ever recover

Nope my other roommate decided to move out out of no where texting me “figure it out” now I can’t pay their side of the rent this month, not to mention they are currently trying to convince my other roommate to leave with them so I just get fucked. 
so now on my birthday I need to figure out how I’m going to come up with an $600/1200… awesome. 
And just the icing on the cake I get called up by my mother on my birthday and before she wished me a happy day she asks what I’m doing with my life.

I’m quite aware this isn’t the worst situation anyone has dealt with believe me but all this happening within the last week being ganged up and and called things I’ve never been just sucks. Especially since I already deal with anxiety and depression.

She has basically completely lost interest in me and doesn't talk to me very often...

It's like she is a different person and I know I would rather die than live like this.

If I tell anyone,"How I feel or why I feel the way I feel, they victim blame and use it against me. They would take away what little I have left from me. I want to be here but they keep taking so much from me. And if I show any weakness they’ll take it all.

My ex partner used me for months and cheated and lied behind my back a lot. He never will admit it. And the way he emotionally abused me… I don’t know, I’m really stupid, I trusted him, I believed he loved me when it was really obvious he never did… and I got pregnant and he was just like “ok see ya.” He wants to coparent but he’s moving across the country? And I haven’t seen him in months now, he has no plans to even be there for me before I have this baby. 


I keep thinking about my degree I just got. Or how I scheduled an abortion and he begged me to cancel it and I did. Or like before he deployed, he didn’t spend time with me the last day there, he didn’t cuddle with me that last night there, and he didn’t make plans for me to see him leave when all the other women like dress up and take photos by the planes. I remember crying so much that morning, he layered on the cologne. Obviously it wasn’t for me.

And he just left. He just texted me a few days later it’s over and it’s
Not cheating if were not together and he didnt give a fuck how i felt and he still is like indifferent and mean as fuck to me and does not give a fuck
And i dare ny know who this fucking perosn is
I dont know who the fuck this person is

But i hve ptsd from a man raping me
And a boyfriend beating me up a loy
And this feels so mych worse

I was suicida for a while over the other things
I was diagnosed with ptsd and have disability
But now its like 1000000000x worse

"I feel incredibly guilty, but I don't have other options","I'm posting here so it's not a secret that I'm planning to end my life in the near future. It's not like I feel completely alone in the world, but I just don't think I'll ever be able to live a life where I don't feel like I'm suffocating 90% of the time. I have a boyfriend who loves me, I have a best friend who cares about me, I have a dog who depends on me and loves me unconditionally.. Yet, I don't think I'll be able to go on much longer. 

I feel like I screwed up my life for good, it's like I lost a lot of my childhood and all my teenage years to trauma and abuse. I struggle to make meaningful connections, I am unable to care for my loved ones the way I would like, I don't think anyone is better off for having known me. But I know my actions will hurt people. I think that even though my dad has replaced me with his new family and my mom shows little regard for my well-being, they will probably be hurt. I know my boyfriend and friends will be hurt, even though I think this is best for them in the long run. I know my old classmates, family members, and acquaintances will probably be hurt. It's sad when someone dies. Regardless of how little you care about them.

But here I am, feeling more guilty than I thought would be humanly possible. I have the opportunity to contact my doctor and be admitted to the hospital if I need to... But I don't see the point if I'll still be stuck feeling this way regardless. I have some good days, I feel genuine happiness, I can crack joke, feel loved and love others. But it's not enough for me. I don't know what I need. I don't think there's anything more the universe can offer me. I am incapable of long term happiness, and small goals like making it until my favorite artists drop their next album, or waiting until I finish playing a game, or watching a show till the end before I end my life aren't enough anymore. Nothing is enough anymore. 

I am so privileged to have the life and opportunities I have been given, even with all the shitty things that have happened to me. I have a decent support system around me, and it sucks that I'm letting them down... But it feels like my only option, and it's the only thing I can think of that comforts me in the slightest.",Lilla_puggy,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/od7eic/i_feel_incredibly_guilty_but_i_dont_have_other/,posting secret planning end life near future like feel completely alone world think ever able live life feel like suffocating 90 time boyfriend love best friend care dog depends love unconditionally yet think able go much longer feel like screwed life good like lost lot childhood teenage year trauma abuse struggle make meaningful connection unable care loved one way would like think anyone better known know action hurt people think even though dad ha replaced new family mom show little regard well probably hurt know boyfriend friend hurt even though think best long run know old classmate family member acquaintance probably hurt sad someone dy regardless little care feeling guilty thought would humanly possible opportunity contact doctor admitted hospital need see point still stuck feeling way regardless good day feel genuine happiness crack joke feel loved love others enough know need think anything universe offer incapable long term happiness small goal like making favorite artist drop next album waiting finish playing game watching show till end end life enough anymore nothing enough anymore privileged life opportunity given even shitty thing happened decent support system around suck letting feel like option thing think comfort slightest,feel incredibly guilty option,2232,56

Sick with no diagnosis,I’ve had gi problems for 15 years. Was told it was ibs and I went on living my life and managing it as if it was. Then 4 years ago I got really sick and no dr could figure out what was wrong. Multiple cat scans scopes bloodwork er trips all amounted to nothing. Then one day a dr looked at one of my scans and found a narrowing in my colon but he didn’t know how I got it so I got sent to a national hospital for another opinion and they told me the dr was wrong there is no narrowing. I came back home and we did another test which confirmed the narrowing. I had surgery to have it removed and was excited. Finally something is there that explains my gi problems and it’s fixable. Ever since the surgery it’s been downhill. My gallbladder died and had to be removed. I have gastroparesis now which they claim is idiopathic but I did not have it prior to the surgery. My right colon remained distended so I had another surgery to bypass my colon but again I’m getting sicker. I’m losing weight and some days it feels like if I just let go and stop food and water I would pass away. I’m married I have a beautiful wife and two awesome kids. One of my children now has crohns and I always suspected that he got it from me and that how come they can’t find mine and treat me for it. I think about suicide a lot lately but I keep fighting for answers and relief and I feel like it’s coming to an end. Like a weird feeling that I got weeks maybe months left until I either pass away because I’m so weak now from malnutrition or the pain will become too intense that I’ll kill myself.

I hate the role society has placed on men,"We can't complain about any of our issues because when we do, no one cares. We are always expected to be the eternal providers at everything. In a relationship, we should give everything to our partner, and talking about our needs is shamed. Women are actively scared of us and think that our bodies are ugly. They hate looking at our bodies and they try to discriminate against us almost everywhere we go. No one cares about how we are being raped and how women-on-men rape and sexual assault is not being included in statistics. No one cares about how we face domestic violence. No one cares about we face all of the responsibilities in society and get none of the rewards.

I dated multiple underage people while I was in my 20s and all my friends have left me over it. I really just want to go somewhere I can't hurt anyone anymore,"I'm a guy in my 20s and from when I was 19-21 I dated three underage people age 15-17 as I didn't see anything wrong about it at the time. I dated people my age too and for longer as well, I was really just desperate and bad at relationships. But when my friends found out about it and I tried to explain that to them they all abandoned me. I lost my job over it too and I haven't been able to hold down a job since. I've basically spent the last year plagued by such guilt, shame and bewilderment as to how it came to all this that I've not been able to do much else but browse Reddit and hope to die soon.

I've tried talking about this with some former friends and they all say that I'm a groomer, that I'm abusive and a liar and I just never wanted to be any of those things. I never realized I was. So I've been to therapy for the past year, got diagnosed for some mental disorders, tried different medications but I ultimately know it's no use. The people I would like to prove to that I never meant to do any harm and that I can be a better person are out of my life forever and this isn't something you can just ""move on"" from anyway. And I don't think I want to either. What kind of sentiment would that set about society and the kind of people we allow to live among us.

Pushed to the brink of suicide because of OCD,"
I suffer with a fairly common, yet not really talked about OCD subset that focuses on extreme distress and fear of becoming a Pedophile despite probably being the furthest thing from one. 

It’s just so incredibly difficult to even live with myself somedays. And honestly sometimes the horrible thought spirals can eat up multiple days. 

I just feels so incredibly real even though I know logically that it’s not. Which in a way is worse because I’m kinda going crazy split between my reasoning side and my emotional side.

I’m tired,"I lay here at 9 pm in bed. I’ve finished my day of gaming and eating and it’s only to repeat tomorrow... 

I’m 26 and I’ve accomplished nothing in any of them 26 years... 

I’m a failure in everything I do I have literally 0 friends. I lost the only job I was capable of. 

I can’t work now because the idea of work makes me feel physically sick.  The only friends I did have turned their back on me and got me arrested with fabricated accusations of harassment. 

I have undiagnosed mental illnesses I don’t know how to deal with. 

I do actually have a partner but he is 400 mile away and previous financial difficulties and the recent pandemic has stopped me from being with the man I’ve grown to love full heartedly over the span of 10 years. 

It’s like the universe has a very cruel joke. 

He’s the only man I love and will ever love and I can’t even see him! 

I have no children either. Just lately I’ve been feeling so empty and lonely and I have nothing to look forward too. The plan to finally see my love was ruined because of COVID so that’s no longer in sight. 

I JUST WANT TO DIE! BUT I CANT DO IT!  

I can’t do it because I’m scared of the consequences after. 

I want to walk out in odd hours of the early morning to hope I bump into someone who’s angry enough inside to get rid of me just because humans seem to have no love for other humans anymore so it’s easy to kill. It’s easy to spend 10-20 years if you’re caught for a petty murder ‘just because’

"Working and living in Germany, losing my mind.","Currently living and working in Germany. Every aspect of my private and working life makes me losing my mind day by day. Some of the colleauges make fun of you, which feels funny for the white Germans, and you have to laugh about yourself, otherwise you are not ""fit-in"". They expect full friendliness and politeness from you, but gives nothing but vent and sarcastic comments in return, for the sole purpose to make you feel you are not worthy enough to work with them. And every single kind of help or even gesture from them, they expect you to treat it as if it were given from the god himself. 

On my private life, letter delivery service (Deutsche Post) is not working;  medical system is notoriously hard to find a doctor to accept public insurance in Berlin, not to mention for specialists; my landlord not taking responsibility to take care of the house details; Suicidal hotlines only works from 16:00 to 24:00, if you decide to kill yourself outside of the German schedule, you can just go ahead. 

About the letter delivery service: my name is written along with my landlord's name (mine is a Asian name while my landlord is white German), all his letters are delivered while all of mine are returned back to the senders. And sometimes I receive letters addressed to other Asians. (These are just spellings with 26 letters, not even real Asian language.) 

I just dont want to go on the list of problems living my life as a foreigner here. And if you are a German and reading this, you will say it is my problem (I am not doing it right for a million reasons, and I will say you are right, as long as I dont have to hear it.)

i broke up with my soulmate 6 months ago and I still can't find the energy to do anything.,"Before I explain what's happening to me, I need to give some context. I met this girl, we'll call her Marcy, in 2019 through a friend. I was pretty down on myself at the time, and he gave me Marcy's snapchat because he thought we would be a good fit. He was so painfully right.

We called each other for most of the following days after we met, and the calls would go to absurd lengths. We ended up just leaving them on when we slept so we could talk while we were going to bed, I think our record call length was around 27 hours.

So, you get the picture. We instantly connected and it was seriously one of the weirdest feelings I had ever experienced. It felt like someone was finally looking at my soul instead of me just as a person. We dated for around 4 months, and then she broke up with me. We were both 16-17 at the time, so it definitely felt like a teenage relationship with a weird amount of connection.

Fast foward to 2020, we end up dating again for around 6 months before things start to get a little rough. We both opened up about some insanely personal mental health issues, with mine mainly consisting of a ton of suicidal thoughts. We sort of just... imploded. Things were really uncomfortable for about a week, and I very irrationally broke up with her. It was a very spur of the moment decision, looking back. We constantly talked about ideas for cool weddings, what we would do when we were super old, it was genuinely some of the most personal love I have ever felt.

Fast forward another 6 months after I broke up with her. I'm still basically in the same spot I was right after we broke up. I wake up exhausted, but it feels almost impossible to sleep without her there, given that we were essentially the same person. On top of really bad insomnia, I sleep about once every other day.

 We spent the better part of those 6 months of dating together, and I mean that very literally. We had multiple month stretches where we slept in the same bed, woke up and went about the day, then went back home together. My friend that introduced me to her has always said that he is the world's best friend for introducing us, but now that things are the way they are, all he wants me to do is move on.

I honestly believe it's impossible without a whole lot of time passing. I cannot find a single reason that justifies living, especially when put into comparison with how sad I still am about it. My future is pretty dim, I definitely don't have enough money for college but I'm moving in a month to go to college anyway. I don't even really feel fear about any of this anymore, as it feels like nothing i do will distract me from the fact that I nuked most of my life with this. Marcy was the only one who made it feel like someone understood what I felt on a daily basis, but I couldn't think of that *one* time before making the decision to end things.

I just want to sleep forever.",loocylium,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ocvzqo/i_broke_up_with_my_soulmate_6_months_ago_and_i/,explain happening need give context met girl call marcy 2019 friend wa pretty time gave marcy snapchat thought would good fit wa painfully right called following day met call would go absurd length ended leaving slept could talk going bed think record call length wa around 27 hour get picture instantly connected wa seriously one weirdest feeling ever experienced felt like someone wa finally looking soul instead person dated around 4 month broke 16 17 time definitely felt like teenage relationship weird amount connection fast foward 2020 end dating around 6 month thing start get little rough opened insanely personal mental health issue mine mainly consisting ton suicidal thought sort imploded thing really uncomfortable week irrationally broke wa spur moment decision looking back constantly talked idea cool wedding would super old wa genuinely personal love ever felt fast forward another 6 month broke still basically spot wa right broke wake exhausted feel almost impossible sleep without given essentially person top really bad insomnia sleep every day spent better part 6 month dating together mean literally multiple month stretch slept bed woke went day went back home together friend introduced ha always said world best friend introducing u thing way want move honestly believe impossible without whole lot time passing cannot find single reason justifies living especially put comparison sad still future pretty dim definitely enough money college moving month go college anyway even really feel fear anymore feel like nothing distract fact nuked life marcy wa one made feel like someone understood felt daily basis think one time making decision end thing want sleep forever,broke soulmate 6 month ago still find energy anything,2903,90
I was writing out a suicide note again.,"I was writing it out, contemplating whether I should use a phone cable or something else to hang myself, wondering if the phone cable would even do the trick.

Nobody has to reply to my post. I just need to get this off my chest and tell someone, anyone.

This is what it says:

**Well, I’m gone for good now. I’m happy it is over. I was just so tired and fed up, stuck, and so, so lonely. I saw no other way out than this way.**

**All I wanted was some help to learn to drive, to watch my dogs so I could go to the dentist, have a couple of driving lessons a week.**

**WAS IT REALLY SO MUCH TO ASK!? To please help me make my life a little comfortable or bearable?  I’d do the same and watch your pets if you asked.**

**It shows how little you cared. I was forgotten about, made to feel I was an inconvenience to your lives. I didn’t even get so much as 5 mins of conversation a week from anyone, and haven't for years. The last time I spoke to anybody was weeks ago. May 14th to be exact.**

i won't be able to live anymore,"&gt; *note: this was in response to a post that said something about you being the only one who wants you to die and that no one else would be happy if you died; in most cases it's true and i agree with that because it's good advice for people who are feeling like others would be better off- but my comment was about my situation being different from that now. but yeah i started typing and wrote too much and i didn't want to bother the OP with my problems when they were just saying something kind and helpful, so i'm posting this on my own here instead*

what do you do though when someone really does want you dead? it's scary and isolating and makes death feel inevitable and like the actual only escape. and it's like, i don't want him to get what he wants but i still don't want to live either. i don't know how to live with someone i loved pushing me this far, i don't feel human at all.

what do i even do with this? i know he's messed up and i know i have value, but something inside me is gone now or broken and i really just don't see myself being here this time next year, i can't.

i'm so paranoid and afraid now and i feel so pathetic and worthless and confused as to how my life even ended up like this. i don't understand and i don't feel good and every time i think about any of it it's just debilitating. i hate myself so much for ending up here, i feel like i should've been smarter and less trusting and less forgiving even though i wouldn't think that way about someone else being in this position. or like, i knew better. i think. but everyone always has told me i'm too cynical and judgmental and untrusting and isolated and slow to forgive and antisocial and then when i tried to do the right things and give benefit-of-the-doubt and a second chance and forgiveness and openness and everything it fucking destroyed my entire life and self and everything about me

it's like, the prolonged state of shock and disbelief and dread and terror of realizing this is all real and not a horrific extended nightmare is too much to bear. my face isn't even moving right now and i don't even feel sad anymore but tears are just pouring down my face like there's someone inside me who is crying but it's not me

No I'm not okay with just being ok with it. This all destroyed my life.

I grew up thinking people actually wanted me around when it was them who didn't see that they only like me for my comfort, my generosity. 

I never was a people pleaser. It only started when I would start losing friends over and over and over again. It wasn't until just recently did I realize how truly fucked I am now.

I cannot control the things that they hate about me,"Just a general vent post that will get lost amongst the others

I have social anxiety, depression, ocd, blah blah blah

  I do not feel as if I am a good person. I have a great deal of empathy for others, but that only gets me hurt in the long run. I complain too much about my mental troubles and how they haven’t gone away. My loved ones just eyeroll at this point, I have been hurting plenty of times before therefore I do not get to complain about the pain anymore. 

    I don’t know if I’m being gaslit or not, seeing as that’s kind of the point of gaslighting. I have been trained to believe that I am always in the wrong when it comes to these things. If I’m not in the wrong, then that means I can trust less people than I thought, if I am, then I’m a narcissistic asshole for thinking what I’m thinking. Idk there’s just no favorable outcome. I’m forcing myself to go to a new school, and I’m naturally terrified about that seeing as I’m the artsy eccentric type who’s really into avant-garde music and all that.

    But the main thing that has got me insecure and depressed are my fetishes. Everywhere I go online it seems it’s just people being mocked over their fetishes and kinks. I cannot rationalize my kinks as I know that I am the problem. I did not ask to be into this shit. I usually come on this sub every day on my main acc and search for people who are also dealing with insecurities over their fetishes and see if I can’t offer some sort of comfort to them, but I saw one post by some person who shared my kink and the replies except for those who also possessed it were agreeing with him that he was fucked up. It just really hurts knowing that I will never be accepted anywhere due to something I cannot control, not even in spaces specifically designed for peer support.

I was just recommended to check out this sub by anonymous redditor,"At first I was like F***, is this the evolution of KYS ? Like some way of calling you mentally unwell

But came here anyway to have a look, read some posts. Not sure how susceptible I am to things but def I think I can relate. 

Personally, I thought random suicide thoughts were pretty normal. Even somewhat useful as a mental no-man's land, allowing a perspective on life entirely, as opposed to seeing one or two things from the vantage point of single pillar of life. Seeing the wood from the trees, in a way.

Wouldn't call it pleasant, because it can last longer than what's desirable/ practical. But it's refreshing when it's over. Allows me to re-establish priorities, which is understandable when the social environment is somewhat unstable at the moment.

Is this a bad sign and I'm just kidding myself? Or is suicidal depression like love, where you won't know it until you just know it? Or possibly something along a linear axis, possibly a Cartesian plane? X-axis = how good/ bad the feeling is, and y-axis = how near/ far you feel from the feeling. I.e. how much it feels like something in your bones, or a thought-process that comes up just like other thoughts can grab your attention.

is there really any point in living when your childhood ruined any chance of you living a normal life,"my childhood was shit. no one cares about me or has ever cared about me. i grieve the child i once was, she deserved so much better, and she deserved to be protected. no child or teenager deserves to go through all i went through. i really don't want to go through the aftereffects of my shitty childhood anymore. everything just drags on.

i was ""that kid"" at school, coming to realize recently that it's probably because of undiagnosed autism. my narcissist dad ruled our family, and i was the scapegoat. my golden child brother shunned me. i would always ask him to play video games with me and spend time with me like a big brother should, and he would curse at me every time. my mother was an enabler to my father and cared more about appeasing him than making sure i was emotionally taken care of.

at school every single kid around bullied me relentlessly and i was known for being the weird kid. every teacher who was at my school except for one lovely black teacher who had my back and regularly lectured me about being a black girl in america, was unashamedly, and publicly racist even though i live in progressive western washington. my 3rd through 5th grade teacher singled me out and traumatized me regularly by yelling at me in front of the class, encouraging other kids to laugh at me and throw things at me, insulting me herself every day, ensuring i didn't get the education i was supposed to, blah fucking blah for 3 years. there's so much worse she did. all i had were video games, professional wrestling and stuffed animals. i had no other consistent hobbies because i was extremely sheltered, even until today, there's nothing i enjoy doing. everything is just to pass the time. i went to wrestlemania 37 in april which was probably the peak of my life.

i'm tired of no one caring about me. no one even reads my bullshit every time i post here because i am impossible to care about. everyone ignores me and i am completely alone, on an island in a sea of people that are in love with each other and appreciate each other and treat each other like they're special and cherished. the one thing about myself that i'm proud of is that i try really hard to go out of my way to make sure anyone is alright whenever i can and love do whatever i can in my power to make someone happy and no one has ever shown me that courtesy. i love to listen to people and try to make them feel heard and respected and important. i love very easily, i sincerely love even strangers i chat with on the street, and kids i wave at in shopping carts at stores, and friends i talk to once every month. i thought naturally caring and being observant was a normal part of loving someone, but everyone just lies and tells me they love me anyway. there's nothing else good about me. i know this is narcissistic to say but the child i was deserved so much more. every person and every system failed her. i wish i could go back and protect that child. i am a quitter and i will never be able to heal from everything i've felt and seen and been through and i'm tired of holding onto a shred of hope that i ever can. a couple weeks ago, and a few months before that, my mom told me ""if you want to kill yourself just go and do it"". this is the only thing i won't disappoint myself with",honeybabythrowaway,22,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oca74l/is_there_really_any_point_in_living_when_your/,childhood wa shit one care ha ever cared grieve child wa deserved much better deserved protected child teenager deserves go went really want go aftereffect shitty childhood anymore everything drag wa kid school coming realize recently probably undiagnosed autism narcissist dad ruled family wa scapegoat golden child brother shunned would always ask play video game spend time like big brother would curse every time mother wa enabler father cared appeasing making sure wa emotionally taken care school every single kid around bullied relentlessly wa known weird kid every teacher wa school except one lovely black teacher back regularly lectured black girl america wa unashamedly publicly racist even though live progressive western washington 3rd 5th grade teacher singled traumatized regularly yelling front class encouraging kid laugh throw thing insulting every day ensuring get education wa supposed blah fucking blah 3 year much worse video game professional wrestling stuffed animal consistent hobby wa extremely sheltered even today nothing enjoy everything pas time went wrestlemania 37 april wa probably peak life tired one caring one even read bullshit every time post impossible care everyone ignores completely alone island sea people love appreciate treat like special cherished one thing proud try really hard go way make sure anyone alright whenever love whatever power make someone happy one ha ever shown courtesy love listen people try make feel heard respected important love easily sincerely love even stranger chat street kid wave shopping cart store friend talk every month thought naturally caring observant wa normal part loving someone everyone lie tell love anyway nothing else good know narcissistic say child wa deserved much every person every system failed wish could go back protect child quitter never able heal everything felt seen tired holding onto shred hope ever couple week ago month mom told want kill go thing disappoint,really point living childhood ruined chance living normal life,3272,101

I am going blind,"I think this is it for me. Last 3 months I had a macular hemmorhage in my left eye. It started as a very small dot in my central vision and suddenly it grew one night.

 Doctors prescribed 3 doses of eye injection. It started getting smaller, but I couldn't read text with my left eye. 
After a week from the first injection, what do you know. ANOTHER small hemmorhage. This time in the right eye. It is still small, but based on my left case,  it's a matter of time before it grows big as well.

Life doesn't really give a moment to breathe. These last 2 years are a constant losing battle. I was fired from my job because they needed cut expenses.

It all would be better if I had succeeded.,"I tried to kill myself at the start of last month and the fallout from that has cost me my friends, job, and living situation. While I was in the hospital my older brother told my friends that I had been living with that I only do things like that for attention and to manipulate people which lead to being told by my ride from the hospital that they don’t even believe I tried to kill myself now and that only one of them will answer my phone if I need anything but none of the others will talk to me if I tried. I was supposed to go back to work after missing it for two weeks from a severe concussion before my hospitalization and the district manager was so mad at me missing those shifts that he said “I hope the reason no one has heard from them is because the were successful” and stopped scheduling me. All of my things had been boxed up and moved to my mom’s house before I even left the hospital and the person I would’ve called my best friend answered their phone with “I only answered because you still have stuff at my house” when I called her. That everyone so easily believed whatever my relatives have said about me hurt a lot, especially being told to go back to my mom after everything I told them about my home life. 

But what hurts the most about this situation is that I was right about my doubts I’ve been having with my friends. With some context, family is an f word to me. Because of prior situations with abandonment before and how my own relatives have treated me I’ve always hated being called family by others and still believe that people say it too easily. This entire situation has only validated that for me and I can’t believe anything people have said before now because the people I trusted the most have left me like this. 

Since leaving the hospital and the loss of everyone I care about, I have tried to kill myself 4 more times to no success at all. I tried to overdose on different medications without any observed effect, starving and dehydrating myself only to cave and eat, and even tried to hang myself again before getting caught and having the belt taken away. Even my failure at dying now is driving me deeper into this nothingness that I want to take me because I don’t want to get better alone. Everyone told me that they can’t help me anymore and that I can only help myself now but after all of this I couldn’t even begin to build the care I would need for myself after being left so easily.

In spite of it all I know that they are all better off without me because I’m not a good person for any of them to be around, some have even told me how much better they feel in the month I’ve been gone from all of them. I hurt them all by trying to kill myself last month and they all don’t need me around anymore.

I just wish that I knew what else they believe I lied to them about because they keep telling me that I have been lying to them about a lot of things but not telling me what about, just that I have been lying. I want to see any one of them and just hear what they think and what they were told but none of them have answered my calls in a week now from what I can only believe to mean they’ve blocked me and by all appearances have removed me on all other media.

Even then that would just be for me though because if they really believe that I’m that negative on their lives then they really are better off without me.",ThrowawayLikeMyHope,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ocs7jg/it_all_would_be_better_if_i_had_succeeded/,tried kill start last month fallout ha cost friend job living situation wa hospital older brother told friend living thing like attention manipulate people lead told ride hospital even believe tried kill one answer phone need anything none others talk tried wa supposed go back work missing two week severe concussion hospitalization district manager wa mad missing shift said hope reason one ha heard successful stopped scheduling thing boxed moved mom house even left hospital person would called best friend answered phone answered still stuff house called everyone easily believed whatever relative said hurt lot especially told go back mom everything told home life hurt situation wa right doubt friend context family f word prior situation abandonment relative treated always hated called family others still believe people say easily entire situation ha validated believe anything people said people trusted left like since leaving hospital loss everyone care tried kill 4 time success tried overdose different medication without observed effect starving dehydrating cave eat even tried hang getting caught belt taken away even failure dying driving deeper nothingness want take want get better alone everyone told help anymore help even begin build care would need left easily spite know better without good person around even told much better feel month gone hurt trying kill last month need around anymore wish knew else believe lied keep telling lying lot thing telling lying want see one hear think told none answered call week believe mean blocked appearance removed medium even would though really believe negative life really better without,would better succeeded,3383,42

Why do I live?,"I thought about it tonight? I wondered what it would be like be it bullet through my skull, or lethal injection. I wonder what I would think the moment I did it, would I regret it? I heard that those who fall regret it. I understand. But why do I live? Everyday I am just reminded of constant human cruelty. It’s so fucking cliche but really: no one cares until you’re dead. I can’t stop fucking thinking about it. No one cares until you’re dead. No one cares about your pain unless you have loving parents or if it’s motivated by self interest. No one will love you if you have nothing to offer them, which makes sense. Sometimes I wonder if that’s why no one loves me, I have nothing to offer them, and that’s on me. Maybe I should go through with it, no one fucked up my own life except me. No one is obligated to care. But they’ll care when I’m gone. They’ll be all sorry, why can’t they be sorry now? “I wish I could have done something more” yeah… why couldn’t you? Why didn’t you? They don’t care until the moment you pop. I think I live just so I don’t give them the ability to say such things. And when I die, they’ll care for a second, be sorry for a second, but they’ll go on living. They go on living. Some lives are just not worth living. It’s unfair that some people are just dealt the bad hand in life. Life is unfair, I get that.

"Life is worth living, but isn't at the same time.","People tell me, ""Oh, it'll get better! Things will get easier!"" and they're right, to a certain extent.

I don't think any emotionally painful period of life (like getting fired, loosing someone you love, being in an abusive relationship, etc) will last forever. Everything ends eventually.

But just because you solved one problem, doesn't mean there aren't more lying ahead.

That's what my whole life has been like. I was bullied in elementary and middle school for most of my life, and my parents were abusive. Once I got out of elementary and middle school, I was excited for high school because I wouldn't ever have to see any of the people who ever made fun of me again. But high school wasn't any better. In fact, it was worse. That's when I met my abuser, who was the whole reason for my CPTSD.

Even though all of this shit was happening, the one thing that kept me going was the hope that things would get better. I thought all this pain would end and I would finally get a chance to heal and be happy. 

That never happens though. As soon as one problem ends, another starts.

Not to say that good things didn't happen. My parents and I went to therapy, where they slowly learned how to actually be good parents, and I learned how to cope with everything that's been happening to me.

But like I said, as soon as one problem ends, another starts.

Just when I was just starting to heal, just when my mom and I where just starting to have a normal relationship, my mom died. It made me realize that every time something starts getting better in my life, something terrible happens right after. My whole life has been like this, and it doesn't seem to stop throwing shit at me anytime soon.

At this point, I just give up. I'm tired of having hope, because I know things aren't going to get better for me. I *know* life can be amazing. I *know* there are genuinely good people on this floating rock we call Earth. But good things don't always happen to good people. And I'm not exactly a ""good person"" anyway.

I wish things could've been different. I wish I had a hint of luck, so that, maybe, one good thing would permanent stay with me. But unfortunately, I've been cursed to live this shitty life.

Just wait for me mom. Hopefully, I'll be there soon. &lt;3",sixty__nine,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ocshr2/life_is_worth_living_but_isnt_at_the_same_time/,people tell oh get better thing get easier right certain extent think emotionally painful period life like getting fired loosing someone love abusive relationship etc last forever everything end eventually solved one problem mean lying ahead whole life ha like wa bullied elementary middle school life parent abusive got elementary middle school wa excited high school ever see people ever made fun high school better fact wa worse met abuser wa whole reason cptsd even though shit wa happening one thing kept going wa hope thing would get better thought pain would end would finally get chance heal happy never happens though soon one problem end another start say good thing happen parent went therapy slowly learned actually good parent learned cope everything happening like said soon one problem end another start wa starting heal mom starting normal relationship mom died made realize every time something start getting better life something terrible happens right whole life ha like seem stop throwing shit anytime soon point give tired hope know thing going get better know life amazing know genuinely good people floating rock call earth good thing always happen good people exactly good person anyway wish thing could different wish hint luck maybe one good thing would permanent stay unfortunately cursed live shitty life wait mom hopefully soon lt 3,life worth living time,2271,49

For everyone who is contemplating suicide,"I’m not in anyway against suicide nor do I think it’s morally wrong. It is a way out of prolonged suffering even if there’s no “you” to enjoy that state of non-suffering. I think about killing myself all day, everyday. But I find that life becomes easier with those thoughts. Suicide is for me very comforting, knowing that you are in control and if the pain is too large you can always kill yourself. There’s nothing wrong with that. Who says you should or shouldn’t be the one to choose. Suicide is a very human reaction to all the chaos, meaninglessness and pain in this world. The way I see it is some people kill themselves and some don’t. The decision is not that important, as we are not that important. In a life without objective meaning, maybe it’s rational. Who would be stupid enough to let the pain keep going. But of course a life filled with happiness and love is often subjectively preferable, that’s why we strive and continue. I wish everybody was happy, just for a little moment. But it’s often the lovers that opens there hearts and let the fatal amount of pain come inside.

Tired of hearing the same old shit,"“So many people care about you”
“You’re never alone”
“We all love you so much, please keep going for us”

Somehow I have convinced myself the only way to keep living is for others. Well, then I ask, what’s the point of living if you don’t give a fuck about yourself? I don’t give a shit about myself, I want to die. Grant my one wish and let me die already. Years of going through this unbearable pain and mental weight and I just want to be free of it. They only ever say this shit when they see the scars or if I get caught trying to commit die. 

Nobody is there for me at my lowest. Those times I’m feeling left out and lonely? No one is there. No one. I always message first, I always invite people, I always put in so much effort and care in my relationships and all I get is nothing in return. It’s only when I’m on the ledge suddenly people say they love me so much and would miss me. That I’m not lonely and they’re there for me. Well, really think about that for a moment? Is that really true? Fuck no. You just don’t wanna look like the fool when I actually succeed in killing myself saying oh gosh we did everything we could. Are you serious? 

When I came out to my mom she said, “do you have to be a butch /dyke lesbian, can you please be a pretty lesbian?” I have “accepting parents” sure. Sure.

Society doesn't care for people like me.,"I am a sickly man, but I work hard and I work well. But I can tell I cannot work 40 hours a week for much longer. I am only 30, but my mental and physical health is extremely delicate. I will always need therapy, and bi-weekly doctor appointments. I am easily exhausted. 

I really do good work, and I'm efficient, I just can't do 40 hours a week. I just can't do it. I am so tired and really need extra time to myself to not be suicidal. 

But it doesn't matter if I'm efficient and I do good work. It doesn't matter if I have a degree (actually, that makes things worse hour wise). Nobody wants to hire a part timer. Nobody wants an employee that works less than 40 hours a week, and if they do, the benefits are probably awful and the pay doesn't make up for the lack of hours. 

I think maybe I could handle 40 hours a week if it was in a really meaningful and balanced job. Taking care of animals, people, or nature.

But that doesn't matter to society either.  Those types of jobs are paid shit-tier. We've built an economy that cares only about business, shareholders, and profits. The economy doesn't care about empathy, humanity, animals, or the future of the Earth. 

Society does not value me. In fact, they see me as a pain. If I give up on the 40 hour work week and go on welfare, I'm lazy, I'm a leech. If I allow the 40 hour workweek to push me to suicide, I'm selfish. 

I exist only to line the pockets of the rich. My feelings and welfare are irrelevant.

My life is big circle in which iam only unaware being of me being me .,"I don’t know what happened to me but something must’ve . I’m 22yo male who instead of living life and enjoying new possibilities it offers , meeting new people , discovering my strengths and being am stuck . I’m stuck in the past , stuck with vivid PTSD like flashbacks , depression , feelings of worthlessness, avoidance of others , unreasonable anxiety , fear , irrational beliefs and despite evidence , only one who is blind to myself . Why I came to this conclusion ? I can’t stop trying to find what’s wrong with me , I live like behind dream wall , my vision is kinda softly blurry and my every decision , my behavior , my life I live against myself . Whenever I want girl I avoid her despite wanting her and feeling attraction is mutual . That feeling is terrible instead of butterflies or whatever while I chase girls who literally avoids me avoiding girls who like me . I avoid people who like me and make extra effort to be liked by people who don’t like me or even hate me . I feel like everything I do is upside down . I fucking live in upside down world in which iam sure of nothing feeling like pieces of me are not me but someone else’s. I feel like some of my responses are not my own because I heard them from someone else so I feel like iam different person . From young age I have intense nightmares which I still have . Now I even have vivid images of me hurting myself out of unreasonable anger and sadness . I feel hopeless and I just spend my life lying on bed hugging pillow and crying . This state dissapeared twice or thrice . Once I had great orgasm after which I felt like I’m out of this prison but after few minutes as if the world started lagging and I was back in crippling anxiety . I once practiced mysticism and got into few second state where I felt light and once I talked to a guy and was explaining something . As if I escaped myself for a second and I got beyond this circular duality . As if result of my thought process went beyond its beginning : if A is B then B leads to A but for a second I somehow got to C and for a moment I felt like my vision came back to normal . I’m so invested in myself as if I was fighting against myself but I can’t win or lose . I don’t see cause . All my life family and some friends told me that I do the same things all over again , that I don’t listen . I live in this bubble where there is barely any novelty , no will , no vitality , just endless quest for : what the fuck is wrong with me . I don’t know who iam and I don’t see cause . I’m no longer able to function , simplest things totally get me crying or angry . I want to leave myself , I desire to let go of myself , I want to die , I don’t wanna be me not me .

Lost the girl cause of my emotions,"I'm returning home soon. Its a 7 hour trip back to where I live. Got laid by crush of 4 years. Felt like a dream. Admitted my feelings. She didn't realise I had intense feelimgs all these years which is understandable since she has had multiple boyfriends in that time. She did it as a *favour* but it sucks when you do someone a *favour* and it turns extremely emotionally. She hasn't left my head in 4 years and I compare every single other girl who approaches me to her and do nor want their love or nothing. Only hers. But its getting harder, to not tell her brother who i was supposed to be visiting and I ruined my close close relationship with her. It was just starting to get into the *friends with benefits* stage and I fucked everything up. However ive decided im ending my life as soon as I return home and not write a single letter. I feel defeated and my emotions are everywhere. It's okay tho. Ive been considering suicide for around 2 years now but I now know I can never truly get the girl I wanted all my life and am deciding to eliminate me from the picture. That way I know the problems removed from her life. Ive only told her ive attempted suicide 6 months ago on pills but only took 3/4ths of the lethal dose required because i was afraid.

Nothing ever changes,"None of this ever gets easier. Nothing helps, doesn’t matter what the fuck I do. I’m trapped in an endless fucking cycle of constant suffering. Right now I’m sitting here typing this sitting on the weights bench in my basement because I can even get my arms to reach down and pick up the weights. I’m just hunched over with my head hanging down doing nothing like a fucking Idiot, just cycling between gritting my teeth to try not to cry and just feeling completely empty. 

This always fucking happens, I’ve been here so many times but the cycle never ends. I don’t even get good days, just kinda shitty days and really shitty days. It’s never better. Nothing makes a difference. Therapy isn’t helping me. Not at all. All the medications don’t do a fucking thing. Exercising, eating right, still no fucking change. It doesn’t matter how much effort I put in, how hard I try, I’m still in the same fucking hell loop.

I don’t look forward to anything. I don’t want anything, except to not have to feel anymore. I used to want things but all that’s done for me is open my eyes to why I either can’t have those things or don’t want those things. I wish I could just think super hard and give myself an aneurysm or a heart attack or something and then it would just be over. 

Nothing gives me purpose. I derive no meaning from any sort of work. I don’t like to create things and I lack the focus to anyway. Helping people doesn’t make me feel anything at all. The is no meaning to my life at all and I can’t give myself any no matter what I try.

The only eventful thing that seems to happen in my life is that I constantly get completely crippled by my own mind. I feel like I’m living on a planet where for some reason gravity acts much stronger on me so everyone else seems to be able to walk around with no issues but even just standing up is a constant battle for me and I just look like a freak because no one else around me feels what I feel and they can’t see it either so they don’t understand. And now I don’t even know why I try to stand up anymore, it doesn’t get me anywhere and I’d be better off just letting the gravity finally crush me.

Don’t even know why I’m typing this, I guess it’s just my way of sitting on this fucking weights bench telling myself I’m doing *something*. I’ve already heard all the usual advice and none of it helps. I already go to therapy, I already do the things they tell me to, it doesn’t help at all. I’m already on medication, I’ve been on so many by this point, none of them made any difference at all. I’ve heard that “it gets better” a hundred times from people who just tell you to wait an indeterminate amount of time for something that may or may not actually happen, as if that’s some comfort. Besides, you can say I’m just being negative and pessimistic when I say I know I’ll still get like this again in a matter of months, but you can’t say I’m wrong because all the evidence points in the other direction. And because someone always says it, I’m not calling a suicide hotline. I don’t even know who those things exist for, those calls have only ever made me feel more suicidal afterwards, they’re less than useless.",BadCaseOfBrainShakes,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ocucil/nothing_ever_changes/,none ever get easier nothing help matter fuck trapped endless fucking cycle constant suffering right sitting typing sitting weight bench basement even get arm reach pick weight hunched head hanging nothing like fucking idiot cycling gritting teeth try cry feeling completely empty always fucking happens many time cycle never end even get good day kinda shitty day really shitty day never better nothing make difference therapy helping medication fucking thing exercising eating right still fucking change matter much effort put hard try still fucking hell loop look forward anything want anything except feel anymore used want thing done open eye either thing want thing wish could think super hard give aneurysm heart attack something would nothing give purpose derive meaning sort work like create thing lack focus anyway helping people make feel anything meaning life give matter try eventful thing seems happen life constantly get completely crippled mind feel like living planet reason gravity act much stronger everyone else seems able walk around issue even standing constant battle look like freak one else around feel feel see either understand even know try stand anymore get anywhere better letting gravity finally crush even know typing guess way sitting fucking weight bench telling something already heard usual advice none help already go therapy already thing tell help already medication many point none made difference heard get better hundred time people tell wait indeterminate amount time something may may actually happen comfort besides say negative pessimistic say know still get like matter month say wrong evidence point direction someone always say calling suicide hotline even know thing exist call ever made feel suicidal afterwards le useless,nothing ever change,3172,20
My strength is fading,"Hey together, I (M/20) could need some advice. I’ll try to sum up my problem as quick as possible. 

- Just read the Text and I can’t really express myself because I’m not a native English speaker but I hope you get my point.

Since day 1 the odds were basically against me. Growing up without a dad, my mom being so sick to the point that she is not able to work. Having to raise myself for the most part since I’m 12. Living in public/social housing etc. 

First it was a motivation for me. I’m gonna beat the odds bla bla. But now my strength is fading day by day and death starts to sound like a salvation for me. 

I’m devasted because since I have to care for me and my mother I knew I had to get some money. So I did school and landed a decent paid job ngl. But the job is killing me. I leave the house at 7 am - come home at 8pm then I cook and then I go to sleep. That has been my life for the last 3 months. I just want someone to support me. I’m alone since I’m 12 man and I can’t take it anymore. Then I met a girl. We talked everyday for 8 Months. We met a couple times and she knew my intentions with her (I was 110% in love). 
Suddenly she had a boyfriend and my best friend told me he fucked her basically the whole time we were talking. 

Man since that I can’t eat or sleep anymore really and it’s 6 months ago. 

I always thought if I take all that shit and stay grinding it will get better. But it just doesn’t 

So matter in fact I can’t take it anymore. I can’t be alone for another long period while hustling everyday without any support. 

I tend to ask why me?

"I’m a 18 years rich guy but when I look for people I feel isolated, I don’t know if I could have asperger (thinking about dead) (long story sorry if is too much)","Hi everyone this is the firt blog I ever writte in Reddit and for explain it better I will say how I got here with this story and how I feel that in resume is I’m care free if I don’t last long, at the present time Im not planning to kill myself even that I thinked and fantasized about it in the past no longer than half a year ago, i was always visualizing myself cover of blood sitting on the floor, resting my back in a wall in the middle of the sidewalk looking with a sincere smile of relief to the front of me and people just walking giving a short look with their eyes and then continue their way like nothing happened or taking one gun and shooting it in my brain just after writing a large note in many pages of a notebook, now im 18 years old, I have never done a mental evaluation with a profesional so is an unknown area for me, in august of 2018 I signed up for boxing at a local gym, my reasons were that I considered myself weak and I just couldn’t stand the idea and also to get a six pack so I could date a neighbor female friend of my same age that I liked since I was 12 and she knew about it but told me to get ripped or get a six pack because i didn’t conviced her enough by that time I already moved home but I still visited her, I enter for the first time to the gym and that first day and the next two weeks I was feeling like collapsing, my body was doing something that never in my life did except for ocasionally running for one hour two or three times per week playing with my neighbors who also were my friends, I took all that physical effort and continue training to get my reward but things didn’t turned well with her literally 16 days later because she liked other two dudes and I was just the second option after a dude that behaved similar to me but was way more taller and buff, i knew there’s no magic on Earth to be that bigger not with the body I had, two days later we stopped contact  until 6 months later in her birthday and she invited me one day before it just because my mom told her mom if I would be there or something, after that day we entirely stopped all kind of comunication and she completely ghosted me for life, after 4 years from 12-16 years old knowing each other, like complete strangers, after that I obsessed with training and couldn’t care less if I felt tired or physical pain I just wanted that rush of adrenaline to feel alive, I was in first year of high school but i was the quiet kid that is practically an invisible ghost for everyone except when there were team works, Sport classes or if I greeted or say bye to anyone, those were the only moments I was visible, there were times that just for no reason I walked around the hole classroom with a bag of candies that I bringed from home, and asked each one if they wanted some and also choose the ones they wanted, I felt like Santa doing that and I liked it even if no one from there would see me than nothing more than just some classmate fortunately no one bullied me, my dad frecuently  kept check on me, i live in a medium size coast city, also I live in Latin America,  my entire high school years were meh only thing exceptional has been boxing and a pretty quiet girl I liked and confessed once and naturally she gently rejected me after thinking her answer for a hole minute and then told me “ No, but I don’t want you to feel bad”, and i had completely Zero nothing to do with her and spended the next three months looking at each other and then the year ended ,  literally that’s all from that there’s nothing more about high school that I could even care a microscopic piece about.

Two months and a half ago I met and lived my first romance story in my entire life and gave my firsts kisses with her, I felt so unstoppable and happy, i felt like i found the light of grace with her, and I could just not stop of holding hands and hugging her meanwhile she beautifully smiled at me and returned the hugs and took my hand in her waist to hold her, sadly she lives in another city at 82 miles from my city I know doesn’t look that much but the road is like two hours driving and she is no willing to have a long distance relationship and I understood it and continue my life, my dad is literally a millionaire with lots of money  and I’m starting colleague in one month, here colleague is not that expensive depending where you study and my college is kind of cheap because I told my dad that I didn’t really care about where I do college at the end I just want that paper title and do my job well, I have practically all my life solved and shit but I still don’t know how to find love and I neither have a single group of friends, I separately have just 6-7 friends in total and just one of them I can call a true friend, I don’t know the others well or their lives, even that I know them from many years ago I just happened to get along well with them and that’s it, i started becoming more social two months and a half ago because of that girl I met at that time and a cousin of mine who coach me with that, i have been getting fun lately since that two months and a half until the present time but things won’t be sugar candy long enough because my cousin’s dad who is my uncle will get out of jale and he wants me and everyone at my house death, he already tried to kill us twice over the years sending us hitmans to go and find us, yeah he did it meanwhile in jail who the hell knows where he got the money from to hire them, so he is gonna be legally out in a few months but this time he will be the one killed by his enemies because he went to prision for kidnapping the daughter of a Power national family and that pissed off a very powerful man who is or was the father of that girl and i don’t think he will receive him with hugs, so yeah there’s a low chance that i could die being full body shot out of no where meanwhile I drive, walking or whatever place I happen to be at the moment, that’s how it works, right now I’m just thinking in make friends, get a girl, chill and boxing, even with the world almost falling down around the corner im calm with it, life is just normal and sometimes to not get bored I have the action at the boxing gym and I want to be professional and have this feeling that I don’t care that much about my life, I just happened to saved myself from dying three times last week I was just about to crash directly with a bus that was coming directly at me the two of us speeding up directly face to face I skipped it by rudely moving the steering wheel and the second time sting a motor bike I took it to the air jumping 7 feet from the floor and that 440 pounds could ve land on my back but it didn’t I was lucky also I nearly fall in barbed wires which would ve decapited me or getting free expose my organs, I controlled the vehicle on time an saved me, I avoided death by pure instinct and reaction but almost every single day before sleep I think about my death and I never see myself beyond my thirties because I fear being left all alone i wouldn’t see joy in a all solitary life, if that happens I will inevitably obsess with something to keep my mind going, I have been with that though for the last two years I happen to loss completely myself in my mind wachting it clearly as a movie, that moment and my funeral, lately I do it as a way to remember myself that there are people that care about me and it’s unfair to just left them and  contradictorily I ve been putting myself in danger lately and none of that times something happened to me by pure luck, I played with luck, my dad, my closest friend and a two female friends told me to take care of myself and one told me that she doesn’t want me dead, my mom and my little sister died when I was 8 my parents were already divorced by that time, and my dad got married many times, my whole biological family is just a money hungry wasp nest and are by no way my family,  some members of my step family and my dad are my family, i started looking to hang out with people since two months ago and realized how isolated from everyone i was, I was literally a living robot with no life aside of responsabilities from every day and training, I found joyness to life not just boxing but the reality is that deep down i just don’t care about my own life and have to always cover my mind with all I can, I don’t know why but I constantly imagine myself dying

What is the point anymore...,"What is the point of continuing this pointless game of life? I am in a position of no recovery in my life, only 21 years old and over the last 4 years I went from the top of my life (feeling like a king) to the absolute fucking bottom and I truly mean the bottom.

I fucked up during my first 2 years of college, blindingly falling in love with a women that was using me for 2 years...but Ignored many of my friends telling me of this because there is ""no way someone could do something that cruel"". I changed as a person and that made me lose many of my friends especially one of my closest best friends after a heated argument we got into. It's been about 1.5 years and my only social contact left is my family and younger brother.

I've become a fucking ghost on social media developing an odd behavior of taking weeks to respond to someones snapchat message/IG message which also greatly contributed to the death of my social life. I dont know what to do anymore to fix this.

\&gt;I failed my social life

\&gt;My grades have tanked in college dramatically

\&gt;I failed my ambitions of going to medical school, basically shitting on my now deceased mentor who guided me on my path to my goal

\&gt;My day for the last 1.5 years has consisted of waking up, doing ZOOM UNI, going to the gym, and sleeping

\&gt;My younger brother has a better social life then I do, a fucking embarrassment..

\&gt;Im a 21 year old fucking loser who didnt realize his mistakes till it was too late and will be punished for them

I have seriously lost all ambitions and hope of fixing this disaster. It's over for me and the only way out is ending this shit. The only thing left keeping me afloat is the hard acceptance of the eternal pain I will cause to my loving family. I dont know what to do anymore, I reached out to that best friend I mentioned earlier several months ago and took full blame for the conflict we got into but it has never been the same again. We came to terms but that's it, nothing else has happened.

This is not a secret to my family as well as in my senior year of highschool ( I wont go into the details why) but I tried to take my own life and my mom and brother caught me. I promised I was just drunk but it was total bullshit and this happened 4ish years ago before my life turned around temporarily. 

This depression is nothing new in my bloodline as one of my relatives also took his life in a similar situation, unfortunately my bloodline has been crushed by suicide. I will follow the path soon as well, I cant take this shit any longer, I played the wrong moves and there is no more hope. I hope the rest of you who suffer from depression get a turning point in your lives soon.

I don't think I can trust myself anymore,"I've been six times in the past year, my last one being in February14-March2. I went like 3 months without self harming, but I fell back into it about three weeks ago. I was placed in fostercare when I got out, and I had to fight to be able to stay where I am now because my parents claimed I had ""anger issues"". I'd like to clarify that I don't.

Anyways, I know I might do something I might regret, and that I need help. But I'm afraid that if I do go to my foster parents (who have treated me with kindness the whole time) that they might be disappointed or that the system might remove me.

Before it was being afraid of the consequences when I go home, but now I'm with people that I value. I care about what they think. And I don't want to leave.

I know the crisis inpatient places don't help me. Most make me feel worse to the point that I lie a week or two in. All they do is give me packets and packets and packets that I've done countless times and go over coping skills I already know. I feel like I need to try residential, but at the same time I don't want to leave my new home. I turn 18 in December, and I didn't expect to love past 13. 

I know here I have a better chance at a good life, and part of my brain says that thing will be fine, to push through. It's said that for years.

But it hasn't. Things havnt been fine my whole life, and I don't see the point in living. I don't value my life, and I've tried to end it a few times and I'm addicted to self harm in multiple forms. When I got here I this plethora of positive emotions in a sense, like ""oh wow these people are nice"" or ""I don't have to be scared"" ""I can have an opinion""etc.

But it wore off. Because depression and mental illness doesn't go away.

I don't trust myself anymore, and one part of me wants help and hates the cons, and another part just wants to wait until I snap again.

My first attempt was 23 years ago when I was 11,"I wish it would have just ended then. “Get help.” “Seek treatment.” No one can help me. I have been treated in various capacities since I was 11 and my family found out what I did. Right now I only have enough money to have a psychiatrist, so that’s what I do. I actually have an amazing psychiatrist. But there’s nothing that can help me. I’ve tried all the things. It’s so not fair that there are good people - with loving families, loving friends, who positively impact other people’s lives, who have entire lives of their own ahead of them full of promise, hope, and a sense of purpose if they’re really lucky - who are taken from this world while I still suffer here. Those people who you’ve loved and lost? I wish I could give them back to you and take their place. I would take their place in a heartbeat along with whatever amount of suffering they had to endure. I am of no use to this world. It’s crazy because I tried really hard. So hard. So so hard. But I’m so tired, and I’m so tired of trying. I don’t see the point in it anymore. When you’re 11 it’s easy to hold out for “hope.” You’re 11. You haven’t even hit puberty yet - things are guaranteed to change. Right? Maybe in surface level things but other than that nothing more is guaranteed. Life isn’t fair, hard work doesn’t always pay off, karma isn’t real, and the world is shot to sh*t. I’ve been selling and packing up all of my stuff to make things easier on anyone who gets to have the annoying task of going through a deceased person’s things. I paid down as much debt as I can. I checked and the rest should be discharged when I’m gone. I created a will.

I don’t see a point anymore,"When I was 17 (I’m 22 now) I survived a self inflicted gunshot to the face, the bullet went through my nose and stopped between my eyebrows(it was an old bullet, apparently, so it had “less power”) the surgeons said I was an 8th of an inch from death, I blew out 6 of my teeth and basically put a huge fucking hole in my mouth, now I wear retainers with fake teeth on them. I fucked myself up, I ruined my face, and I’ll never be the attractive young man I used to be, again.

How to comfort someone if they are having suicidal thoughts,"Hello, I apologize if this has been asked already but I really do need some help so i’ve been together with my girlfriend on and off for 5 years (it’s mainly due to her family) me and her are still teenagers but she lives in a very toxic household. We recently started talking romantically once again after around a year of no contact between us. The reason this happened was because the last time we dated i would sneak into her house so we could spend time together since her parents forbid her from dating, they ended up finding out and grounded her for a year the first thing she did when she could use a phone was talk to me about what happened. Basically she lives in a very abusive and toxic household and has a history of self harm. I have been wanting to go to her house and step up to her step dad for the way he treats her and this is what it feels like i’m going to do. She’s going to be having a birthday party in around a a month and she has told me she plans to kill herself after the party could anyone help me comfort her anyway to make her feel better.

Alone.,"I am alone. My family is so overbearing that I can no longer go 10 minutes without them criticizing, judging, or complaining about me, or something that should’ve been “fixed by” me. I am not allowed to do things I find entertaining, and instead should be “reading a book” or “educating myself”. It’s because of this that I’ve become the top student at my HS, soon to be Valedictorian. Yet, nothing pleases them. It’s gotten to the point where it doesn’t even please myself. I feel like shit, every time I get a high grade without even trying, while my friends struggle. It’s because of this i’ve been shunned, every friendship ended because my parents can’t allow time for me to do anything, and it looks bad to others because they assume i’m trying to flaunt something. Even online, games are something I used to love, a place connections could be made so easily over something we both enjoyed. But even there, my friends left me because I had no time for them. I no longer enjoy video games, and instead, just feel so alone. So extremely fucking alone. I sit in my bed all day feeling like shit, it’s not like I can exercise either because my family believes it’s “shaming” them since they aren’t avidly exercising. I’ve gotten to the point where it just feels stupid to live. There is nothing fun for me to do, and I can’t wait for something to come along. I can’t stand living anymore, as if world events aren’t enough, just the feeling of how truly small I am in the grand scheme of things, and to top it all off, my wonderful family.

Is suicide the way out?,"Sometimes I feel like that's my way out. drowning in my sorrow ever since high school.  How the bullies will call me fat occasionally.

I recently lost my dad and my growing depression has worsen ever since. I don't like talking about myself because I know there's people out there that has messed up lives.

I will cause so much emotional trauma to the train crew. my face , body and the paining sound of flesh on metal will forever haunt their thoughts. how can I be selfish to hurt someone else in the process. I try my best to stay strong but the constant stress and fear and this stupid blame game has lead me towards this dark and empty hole a name plate already engraved on the sick looking walls. 

At 20 years old I want to put my life behind. Am I so much of a coward who can barely survive adulthood. It's not just the fact that I can't get over my dad's sudden death, it's because of the fact that I saw it before it happened. a week before we found out we were positive for covid I heard him cough he wasn't at home then. The night he passed away I heard him speak to mum and she was crying. I had asked her if she was alright she said she's fine and she didn't cry. a few minutes late she cried cause she recieved that phone call at 3Am and my world came crashing down. I didn't just lost dad that day I lost my faith. Ever since that day I am lost. with the constant thought of suicide.

The suicide circle.,"I will probably commit suicide in the near future due to circumstantial reasons. Every attempt to ""seek help"" goes one of three ways.  So-called ""mental health workers"" always try to convince me I'm suicidal due to a ""chemical imbalance"", which is demonstrably false. If all of this is just biological, then how come the medications NEVER work? Ive been on every single  anti-depressant there is for several months apiece.... no avail whatsoever. The second BS tactic they try to pull is to convince me that everything is ""perception"" that everything is arbitrary. This is complete bs, there is such a thing as a fact. Imagine a homeless person laying on a park bench on the verge of death due to starvation, and someone walks up and says ""Hey Look at it this way.. at least you dont ever have to be inconvenienced by using the bathroom"". This ""perception""  shit is such a fucking sack of B.S. its not even funny. The third thing they try is the desperate emotional appeal... ""Things get better!"" ..... ""Just wait""... Im sorry but some things just don't ever change, and not everything in life can be changed by a different ""perspective"". This cycle just keeps on repeating itself over, and over, and over, and over, until it doesn't.

I’ve finally made my mind up,"When COVID restrictions are over in my province I’m going to take my firearms safety course so I can register for my PAL and get a gun. 

I will take a few of my favourite things, a backpack with letters to my friends and loved ones, get my last meal and head to my local high school to reminisce about all of the games we played there. Although we lost a lot more then we won, I’m proud to once be apart of that team. Go Saints. 

I’m 23 I wear number 23 for a semi pro team a few towns over, so it’ll be the 23rd of whatever month we end up being free, at the 23rd hour on the 23rd yard line furthest away from the building. I’ll wear my red home jersey to maybe help preserve it from the blood. 

After every big hit I’d lay there hoping this would be the last one. That I would close my eyes and fulfill my dream of leaving this earth from the way I wanted to go and where I wanted to leave from.

Im out of options,"Im angry. Very very angry. All the time. My parents divorced when i was young due to an extremely abusive relationship (i can't stress this enough), and this was all my mothers fault. When my father left she had no one to abuse so she took it out on me. I wouldve been 10 years old. I started growing really fast  and when I became bigger, she switched her target to my sister and only verbally and emotionally abuses me now. 

Things got bad when i was 14, I started popping pills to try and cope as well as black everything out. I don't really want to describe the things my mother has done to me, they are my experiences. I believe this particular thinking has led me to my current state. I cant take it anymore. I stopped the pills cause i was going to far, i was cutting myself just to feel something, now without the pills ive got no escape.  Everyday is like a fucking chore to pull through, bottling up my emotions and keep my head down. Im so fucking tired. If i start taking pills again ill surely overdose but every encounter with my mother im scared ill snap and do something ill regret. Right now just cutting myself first is looking like a bigger and better option. I really dont want to die right now but it hurts so fucking much. Kinda stupid i know, but im a very intelligent kid and in an other fucking circumstance i wouldve had a future ahead of me. It makes me fucking sick.

We people have messed the world up,"There are too many of us and we trample over everything. We build stuff that destroys, destroys lives and habitats. Eventually, we will destroy ourselves. I don't think there is anything to look forward to.

People will think I'm miserable but I genuinely believe that there is no future. We will destroy it - have already destroyed it. For me, that's the reality, the truth. No amount of smiling at funny pictures will change that.

Deadbeat dad issues,"Hi, I would like some advice if anyone can tell me what to do.

I have dealt with low self esteem/depression issues my whole life I'm 23 right now and I feel more suicidal than I ever have after what I found out. I was having a drink with him tonight over a bottle of whisky and my dad told me a bunch of stuff: That I was an unplanned child, that he never wanted to have me, that his best moments in youth was once having sex with my mom for 4 hours and that made me feel disgusted and repulsed. I love my mom and I feel grateful for having her, she cares for me and would do anything, but at the same time I don't blame my dad considering that if he would have raised me he'd probably would have messed me up even more with his bullshit lifestyle/personality issues. I don't know how to feel. I feel like most of my depression stems from this lack of father figure in my life and I don't know how to move on. I feel like I hate my dad and love him at the same time. I can't tell if he really loves me or he just feels he has to say he loves me and would help me if I was desperate, because he feels guilt that he abandoned me early on.

Ultimately, I would nab my young self to escape the dysfunctional household and make her grow up in a protected and safe environment.

A way to get rid of the cowardice?,"Hello, my first time posting here. But we don't care about that so I'll cut to the chase.

My life has been fucked from the start. Born to abusive parents, lived on the streets for years (I am a young adult now), and a whole bunch of horrible events constantly coming at me.

I just feel like it's the end of the line for me and people like me,"Over a year ago now they wrecked my life with a series of lockdowns and restrictions on social movement for some virus, and they didn't care, they took everything i loved off me, and all they wanted to do was protect they're stupid little hospitals, yea people were dying and still are, but i don't give a damn it's not my problem, i didn't cause it, it's not my fault but you still blamed us and wrecked our lives over it! breeded an anti-social generation and locked us up, created a set of restrictions that you and other idiots want in forever.

&amp;#x200B;

Three years ago now i embarked on a lifestyle adventure, i wanted a purpose in life and i found it, i quickly became an advocate for my countries traditional values, i wanted to make sure that none of this stuff died out, but not even two years someone who calls himself prime minister said up yours to me and others with the same interest, i was forced to see all my favorite shops be bankrupted and some of them even redeveloped into retarded flats for these new retards to live in, i was forced to see history smashed before my very eyes, what do they want out of this torture?

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are of no use, they have pro-lockdown and pro-restriction views, everytime a lockdown is proposed they jump on the bandwagon screaming 'yes! YES! YES!' and call them names every time even an ounce of freedom is given back, they just don't understand, they never will.

&amp;#x200B;

The lockdowns have ruined me, i'm depressed inconfident wreck who can't even speak properly anymore, i've all but lost one of my teeth, and it's not as if i can go out and have fun, a dying or dead shop has to be seen, or a social area has to be closed off somewhere because oH No IT cAN SPreAD ViRUS!!!! i'm mask exempt for a reason, because if i was forced to, i would have done it already by now.

&amp;#x200B;

As it is they are trying to justify another lockdown in a few months, they want to remove some restrictions but all the pro-restrictioners are going crazy, including my parents, listen, you idiots, i don't want to live in a dystopian world.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that if there is a lockdown 4 and restrictions are kept, i may not be alive by this time next year, during the first lockdown i tried by *accidently* choking on the awful food i was forced to eat while my parents were watching the weekly propaganda broadcast, some times i wish i succeeded.

&amp;#x200B;

But my religion says you can't do suicide, and i look at my artwork and all the good things i've done for humanity and decide it's not worth it, but still though i'm an awful person who doesn't deserve anything left that even vaguely makes me happy, i've even considered buying stupid material possessions like kilts to get my mind off it, it will never work, all i know is that *IT'S THE END OF THE LINE* for me and people like me, i'll either have to find something else to do, or go.",NoCommunication7,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ocj0fg/i_just_feel_like_its_the_end_of_the_line_for_me/,year ago wrecked life series lockdown restriction social movement virus care took everything loved wanted wa protect stupid little hospital yea people dying still give damn problem cause fault still blamed u wrecked life breeded anti social generation locked u created set restriction idiot want forever amp x200b three year ago embarked lifestyle adventure wanted purpose life found quickly became advocate country traditional value wanted make sure none stuff died even two year someone call prime minister said others interest wa forced see favorite shop bankrupted even redeveloped retarded flat new retard live wa forced see history smashed eye want torture amp x200b parent use pro lockdown pro restriction view everytime lockdown proposed jump bandwagon screaming yes yes yes call name every time even ounce freedom given back understand never amp x200b lockdown ruined depressed inconfident wreck even speak properly anymore lost one teeth go fun dying dead shop ha seen social area ha closed somewhere oh spread virus mask exempt reason wa forced would done already amp x200b trying justify another lockdown month want remove restriction pro restrictioners going crazy including parent listen idiot want live dystopian world amp x200b think lockdown 4 restriction kept may alive time next year first lockdown tried accidently choking awful food wa forced eat parent watching weekly propaganda broadcast time wish succeeded amp x200b religion say suicide look artwork good thing done humanity decide worth still though awful person deserve anything left even vaguely make happy even considered buying stupid material possession like kilt get mind never work know end line people like either find something else go,feel like end line people like,2925,67
I'm so fucking tired of being a tool for my mom,"I fucking hate how she manipulated me my entire life and ruined my relationship with my dad. Always telling me to lie to him and his family for her own gain. Gaslighting me into thinking I was always in the wrong. Her excessive hoarding and negligence almost tore our family apart when the CPS agent came over to check up on child abuse abuse allegations. I dont understand why she continues to do this. Always finding faults in all of us except her. Painting my dad's side of the family as evil monsters ever since I was a child and ruining any chance for me to reconcile with them. 

And yet I still can't find myself to completely hate her because I'm reminded of all the good things she had done for me, but I cant tell if she was only kind to me in order to manipulate me. I dont even know if she sees me as her daughter. Always blaming me for her arguments with my dad when it's completely reasonable for him to be upset. Im just tired of it all. 

I've told her I wanted to kill myself on two occasions and both times she's told me to go ahead and that she'll follow me in the afterlife to torment me.

My disability has been too much on him and I don’t know if my efforts are going to go anywhere. I know my family and friends care for me and that’s why I wish I felt like I had a choice. I don’t want to divorce my husband and I don’t want to give up. Every time I relapse he says I’m back to square one even though that’s not the case. I feel like I heavily reverted to my old shut down self before therapy today. I’m not speaking to him about anything. I’m going to make a plan and set it aside for the right time. If I don’t succeed it will be horrific for me. The only options I feel I have are being normal and functional quickly and get work and be a bigger help but I don’t know how quickly this will happen. I don’t want to divorce my husband but I know we married too young and we were doomed at the start, I almost divorced him within the first month for genuine reasons but I decided to stick it out and I don’t think that even though the former reason isn’t awful anymore I now have the reason of I’m not the right fit for him and I can’t give him what he needs. I don’t want to go back home and try to go to college there, I don’t know what I’d want to do with my life because I know I’d be stuck in my parent’s house for a while. I don’t want to date anyone and I don’t want to have sex. I feel like I don’t have an option moving forward if I continue to fail. I feel like all he does is remind me of my failure. Maybe I’ll be gone but I don’t want to hurt my sister. I don’t want her to see my body dead in a casket. I know it would kill my grandmother. My family and friends would be heartbroken but it would be expected for some. I don’t know how to proceed. I feel like my best option is to have a secure plan ready and if I fail I’ll do it.

Missed my chance to die. Now I'm stuck.,"I had been planning to kill myself for eight years---around the time when I graduated college last spring. I missed my chance, and then my parents hid my dad's guns (or got rid of them completely, idk). Now, I think about other methods almost constantly, but everything just seems like it wouldn't work well. I've been having a lot of health problems for a while that I've been going to appointments for this summer. I have no idea if or when these things will be resolved, though.  


My parents have a horrible marriage that I can't get away from until get a job, but I'm not employable at all. My parents have taken my personality out of me over the last 20 years, I'm probably autistic or something but they didn't even realize, and I'm bipolar (medicated). I feel like I can't smile at other people they way they do to each other, but it seems that every job requires you to either have a chipper personality to bs your way into it or have the experience to get in. Sometimes both.  


I'm going to graduate school this fall not because I want to but because I don't know what else to do and have nowhere else to go. My degree was in mathematics, but in hindsight I don't even know if that was the right thing for me to study. I spend all my time reading and writing, and it's basically the only thing I enjoy doing anymore. I've been writing something every day for about 125 days. Just sort of as an exercise I guess, but hopefully they could also serve as notes. I think all I want to do is write a book, but that's obviously not guaranteed to work out or get away from my parents anytime soon. I have a decent amount of money saved up thanks to my mom, but she's really clingy and wouldn't be able to handle it if I just left and got a random apartment somewhere with no plan or guarantee of an income. My dad is just a deadbeat who's just now realizing how emotionally abusive he's been over the years.  


I didn't make any friends while I was in college---partly because of my health problems. Idk how long I can last waiting alone to see if I figure some way out of this. I know that as I continue through graduate school, my parents are going to do absolutely nothing to straighten themselves out. They barely even realize how badly they've screwed everything up by having a bad marriage, and now they're just going to sit at home and rot while I try to pull myself up from the depths and while my brother is over on the other side of the country with a great job. They're both approaching retirement age too, which makes everything even more of a nightmare.

The person I'm in love with is on the brink of ending it all.,"Three months ago, I met and befriended this very charming and kind guy on the internet, who I eventually fell for. I care a lot about this person; he never fails to cheer me up and motivate me, he always makes me laugh, he's smart and has taught me lots and lots of things that he knows, and he's always really supportive of me and is really kind and sweet. So every day, I try my best to make him just as happy as he has made me.

But there is something that I can't make him happy with. He told me that his family is abusive, and his classmates bully him (for clarification, we are both high school students). His father beats him up regularly, and his mother screams at him and insults him all the time. When he got bad grades at school, he started receiving death threats from his relatives. He also has no friends in school, and literally everyone in his class bullies him, calls him names, and he gets beaten up there too. 

To add to that, his family is in poverty, and he's failing several school subjects, because of all the stress being put on him. He only has online friends, but recently, he has been losing those, too. And to top it all off, his health isn't good, either, since he has heart, lung, bone problems, way too many allergies.... it saddens me so much to see him being subjected to so much suffering. My heart is broken from the frustration that I can't do anything about it all. The most I can do is sit behind the computer, and listen as he tells me what names he has been called that day. It hurts.

Just today, he has been subject to 40+ minutes of getting screamed at by his mother. Right after that, he mentioned suicide to me. When I asked him to clarify, he told me that just a few days earlier, he attempted to off himself, and he has been thinking of attempting again ever since. He just didn't tell me, because he didn't want to worry me. 

At that point, I had a panicked breakdown, and after calming down, I helplessly begged him to hold on a little longer. I told him that he matters a lot to me, and I care about him a lot. I told him that I'll be right there for him with open arms and ears whenever he needs me, even if not physically. I told him that one day, he can say goodbye to his classmates and family, and never has to see them again. But he wasn't convinced.

Although he isn't sure whether to go through with it at the moment, right now, I am worried sick about him. I just wish I could make him happy somehow. I wish I could just make him feel a *bit* better somehow. *Any*how. But I can't. I feel so helpless and frustrated. 

I can't believe I'm about to lose the person I love. I don't want to lose him. I don't want him to die...

Spilled “Black” Blood,"I’ve always just been a good child; quiet, shy, skinny, nerdy and submissive. I remember my mother asked me to get a good average; I had straight A’s for the rest of my life. I was never in trouble, never started fights and was always willing and happy. I loved myself, even though for the majority of my life I was poor and made fun of.

Then something changed; my mother stopped caring. I had no father and she spent most of her time and money showering her boyfriends. She put my needs aside. 

I barely ate, I barely had clothes, and she stopped showing up to the honors ceremonies and stopped filling out school paperwork. I was all alone now.

It was like she was on drugs, she started stealing the little money that I had, and she would force me to spend time with her boyfriends that hated my guts. All I wanted was to be either treated fairly or left alone. She even wouldn’t let me sleep in on weekends, ruining my sleep patterns and making me work harder in school.

After graduating from college my grandmother and uncle teamed up on me and forced me into the streets, my mom didn’t care. This is little, harmless me; not some violent thug drug dealer that’s being abused.

I want to die because my mom wants me dead. She has picked on me and made me a fool long enough. I literally had no one in my corner except her and she abandoned me.

I live in her house; I overheard her say that she was gonna turn my room into a wash room. She was 13-14 when she had me and could not/did not raise a boy to be a man. I came so far and had so much success, only to have it all stripped away.

I really hate her now, as much as she hates me; and because my situation is so extremely toxic, I gotta escape. I was supposed to be so successful but she held me back on purpose like a slave that she is.

She clowns me to her friends for having no money when it’s her fault; which is embarrassing. I bought a nice BB gun, a big bottle of vodka, and am getting sleeping pills tomorrow. Which way to is the question for now.

I listen to a lot of Biggie, Tupac, Nirvana, and Jimi Hendrix who were all suicidal, so that helps.

You would think that a quiet honor student would be respected by his single parent mother, but her jealousies have gotten the best of me.

There is something called “black blood;” It’s a suicide theory that I create. When two random families get together and have a child, the child has black blood; it’s not a unique blood, it’s the blood of two separate families that have come together . It’s up to the parents to love and nurture that blood into warm red blood. If the bloods don’t mix and become one, the person with black blood becomes suicidal. My blood is still black because my mother and fathers families have conflicted.

And that’s why I want to die .

I'm so worn down,"Apologies if this is a little rambling, but I'm at a loss for what to do. I'm in my early 20s, done with a useless college degree and starting to try and work full time. I hate how my current existence feels, and I don't see how to fix it. I've dealt with suicidal ideations/attempts for half my life, been hospitalized twice in the late 2010s for those reasons, where I got my bipolar diagnosis. I live in an unsupportive environment that I cannot afford to leave as I would do even worse, so I need to plan on how to do that but I see so few options. I'm trans and working on starting HRT, but the second I become more open about my identity my current living situation can become forfeit. Recently I feel in love and started dating someone, but the rug got pulled out from under me there and it was apparent I was just being used until she was done using me as a distraction and peaced out. I find it hard to form interpersonal relationships of any kind, but this one seemed so natural and I truly trusted her and was legitimately happy, not in an unrealistic way I knew things weren't and never would be perfect, but I truly felt at peace and that so long as we had each other that makes anything else worth it. 

I've had a history of being abandoned by people in this way, but this time has really left its mark and internalized the feelings and thoughts of worthlessness I always had. they are just facts now, and I can't truly trust anybody new regardless of the kind of interpersonal relationship.

As far as jobs go I have no dream job, no passion that can pay bills, and working full time for a wage i couldn't subsist on without living with others right now has made things a lot worse. The stress of it along with the other issues has me spiraling worse and worse. I can't even talk to someone irl about it, cause if i were honest I'd get hospitalized again, lose my job, have to pay those bills,etc. 

I don't have hope for the future, short term solutions of mine include drinking heavily on days off and daydreaming and sleeping whenever I can to not deal with the reality of the situation. I want to not exist anymore, the only thing stopping me is that I don't have the energy for that either. Not enough to fix things, nor any goal that seems manageable in terms of improving my life or ending it. But at the same time I'm past the point where I went voluntary my first time into hospitalization. So it's just gonna continue to build and get worse until it reaches a breaking point, but I don't know how long that will take or what will happen.

"I tied my well-being too much to my relationship, and now I want to end things","I didn't mean to, I've been really good at handling my suicidal thoughts.

I don’t know what else to do,"I deleted all of my posts this morning after a really bad breakdown yesterday for fear of being doxxed.

I’ve been on the phone with my therapist and psychiatrist for hours. They can’t see me until Wednesday at the earliest.

I’ve reached out to over a dozen people in my area I’ve previously had some kind of working relationship with. They are either out of town for the long weekend, ignored my messages, or straight up said ‘no I can’t help you’.

I do not know what to do at this point. I cannot afford the hospital. I cannot take on tens of thousands of dollars of debt and the horror stories from people who’ve gone and gotten no help make me even less willing.

I have called suicide hotlines, I have called my therapy team, I have called mobile crisis lines, I have called people who know me and I *cannot get help*.

After death,"Edit: I've gotten so many great answers. Thank you all for your input. I feel, well, refreshed! 

I've tried to commit suicide over 15 times in the past 10 years. I'm 25. Thanks to my heavy manipulation and lying about my mental state, I was able to stay out of institutions. With all my conditions, physical and mental, entering an institution would likely result in an even worse outcome. I hate my freedom being attacked by institutionalizion. After certain suicide attempts, and many hours of talking, I managed to manipulate my way out of the system. 
My main question is, regarding your religion, what happens when someone kills themselves? What happens to their soul? 
I do not see any point in remaining, so I'd  really like to find out what happens AFTER death. Religious buffs definitely have an answer, as survivors who have flatlined. I want to know religious aspects and others. Will I be reborn as a baby in an impoverished family? Would I be stuck in lingo until I could be reborn again? Really I am just looking for answers from people who have met death's door. Or people who have religious ideas on the matter. I am, literally dying to find out this information.
Thank you to anyone with a helpful answer.
 If your answer is to get help, trust me, I'm medicated, have help, etc., but that just isn't enough to answer what I need.",truthrequest,35,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oc60vj/after_death/,edit gotten many great answer thank input feel well refreshed tried commit suicide 15 time past 10 year 25 thanks heavy manipulation lying mental state wa able stay institution condition physical mental entering institution would likely result even worse outcome hate freedom attacked institutionalizion certain suicide attempt many hour talking managed manipulate way system main question regarding religion happens someone kill happens soul see point remaining really like find happens death religious buff definitely answer survivor flatlined want know religious aspect others reborn baby impoverished family would stuck lingo could reborn really looking answer people met death door people religious idea matter literally dying find information thank anyone helpful answer answer get help trust medicated help etc enough answer need,death,1347,11

Every day is an existential nightmare,"I have bipolar II, and I've been off my meds due to aging out of my insurance, and the fact that the meds I was on were messing with my liver. My school's insurance coverage doesn't take effect for another 7 weeks, so I'm kinda screwed for meds and therapy until then.

I have to move over 1,000 miles out of state for grad school in a couple weeks, and the thought of leaving my dad behind is killing me. He's been my main support throughout the last few years (especially during the last year I've been living with him because of the pandemic), and the thought of him dying - especially dying when I'm not there - is eating me alive. He works too much for us to really have fun together, and it feels like we're wasting our lives trying to stay afloat.

On top of this, I can't stop ruminating over everything bad I've ever done, getting paranoid over random things, and thinking about how I've not gotten far in life despite being in my mid-20s. Lately, I don't even have the energy to DoorDash, which has been my main source of income for the last year. I also don't have a lot of money, and I owe a ridiculous amount in student loans, which is only going to get worse if I continue with grad school.

it's too much trouble to live,"idk what's the point of this post, but it's too much trouble to live. I honestly don't understand how people can live everyday carefree. Is it ignorance? Them not having a mental illness? Them being born in a good home? Money? Talent?

I personally wasn't born with much in my life, and I've spent years upon years just working my ass off, whether it's for school or to just make money. I'm only 24 but I feel like I'm headed towards my last few years on this planet. Anything going wrong makes me feel suicidal, I'm just tired, really really tired, and I think I'll get to a point where I get so tired that I'll completely lose this life.

messy vent mommy issues go brrr,"Might not be the right subreddit? feeling suicidal so

i was helping my seven year old brother do homework today since mother wasn't there, he had a silent breakdown when i told him he made a mistake ;-;,,, mother yells at him to shut up (yell isnt the right word lol) and blows up at every little thing. he understands the intensity, he understands what she says (calls us things no one should ever hear) while yelling at him, and he knows what'll happen if he makes a mistake. kid already talked abt and threatened suicide when he was like 5 (i was like ""same"" im so sorry ;-;). 

ive had multiple breakdowns in front of her since I was around his age and mentioned wanting to run away or kms several times (not to my mother, i remember her barely being there- tho the whole fam is so chill with it, i rmbr holding a knife to my neck during dinner saying ill kms and no one batted an eye). I reached double digits and my grades were dropping h a r d (tho my mother didnt take notice until corona came cuz we were stuck together),, i screamed at her abt kms when she interrogated why i wasnt attending classes and submitting assignments and she just. straight up dismissed me.

"Basically, Im just a horrible person","So I posted once before on here but for a different reason. I'm sorry but this might be a long post. So from present day I am 13 years old turning 14 in a month or so. I've done so many horrible things in my life and it hardly even started. 
I was bullied some like most kids, but it wasn't much, all that really happened was that I was called ugly a few times but nothing that matters. In a result of that and everything that happened so far, at the age of 6 I believe I fat shamed a kid once and never did that again. Kids were to step on my hands as well because I was protecting a colony of ants, which apparently made me the weird ""girl"". As a kid my parent didn't care much for me or at least It didn't seem like it to me.
My dad and my mom are split up, never married. The reason for that is that my dad is very abusive to my mom, he did horrible things to her that I dont think my mom would like me to explain but within the things that he did to her could've effected me as well. My dad once kidnapped me when I was little for around 6 months and harassed my mom about some stuff. At the age of 3 my brother killed himself, he was 18 and he was a great person from what I've been told, always open, kind, and helpful. My mom never really showed me affection just fed me and bought me clothes but hardly ever hugged me and she always thought I was a bully from what the school had said to her.
I'll admit I was a little but only because of my bad anger issues that I still have problems with. Well enough of that, I'll just explain why I feel like an horrible person. 

As I said earlier, I was a bit of a bully, along with that I've smoked, shoplifted, committed arson and watch porn. The only reason why I did arson, smoked and watch porn was because there was this one girl in my neighborhood that I looked up to and she would tell me to do things like smoke and start fires. She even told to search up porn on the internet, i would always listen to her... and I regret it. I regret all of the things I've done. I hate myself for all of this that I have said. I've watched porn so much that it droved me to do the wrose thing possible... I made my dog lick my down there, and that's why I was here before... but ever sense than I can't stop thinking about all the things I've did in the past and the more I think about the more I wish to die. I really hope that when I do die I get the most painful death there is.
I wish nothing good for me... I've shoplift because I felt ugly and I wanted to look nice so I took things that I was scared to ask my mom to get for me.. I took things that could hurt me as well.. because I feel as if I need to be punished and because my mom keeps taking my blades from me.. 
I know must of this sounds unbelievable and like im seeking attention but I really am not.. I just don't know what to do anymore and I'm scared that I'm just like my dad.. i really don't wanna be a bad person or anything..but even so I know I am. I never had a normal childhood, I would always hurt everyone and everything, I even hurted my mom and her dog...I just hate myself so much and I wish I was loved and cared for growing up. I really hope I die soon not to end the pain but because I dont want to end up like my dad, I don't want to be abusive and disgusting, idont want to be a drug addict, I want to be everything he's not.. part of me hates him because of the things he did to my mom... I know all the things I have done in my life were wrong and I feel extremely guilty for all of them.. I feel like such a bad person, like there's no hope for me.. all I am is a selfish, rude, stupid, useless person that should've known better than to do any of that.

I have no hope in myself nor humanity.,"I usually and very seldom express my true feelings regarding my life and internal struggles. People would describe me in general as a charming and kind compassionate filled person... always providing inspiration to even strangers. However at 30 years old, with the lack of community and emotional support I have been experiencing a never ending existential crisis. I don’t have decent enough parents that can be a listening ear, and none of my friendships are deeply bonded to express my inner turmoil. Since I’m usually the person people complain about their problems to. I work a stressful job, that barely pays for my living expenses or even therapy. I know this sounds like I am complaining but I know my feelings are valid as other have expressed similar conditions. I think about suicide quite often and to be frank it honestly is a perfect way out for a shit filled world. Sometimes I think why this world is so fucked and I am constantly reminded how much everyone is constantly giving their power away to settle for basic lives and no rewards. Suicide is the only way out of this mess I know for a fact for me. I can’t speak for others... as many are busy accepting the bare minimum but using escapism to fill the voids. Even had a realization this has always been my true feelings regarding this rock we float on and each and everyday it is giving me reason to seek peace. We were not here to pay bills... and work under someone else’s rules. I came to conclusion. I have my personal date set to leave this world.

Mental Health &amp; Me,"This may be long and pointless as are many things in my life but I need to write something down.

I will try to summarize and fill this segment with the information that will give you context to my situation and family.


I am M middle 20’s
Small town 150k ish
My life has been a struggle from an early age, I will not go into any real detail but I have only a few good memories of my dad and mom (separated before my birth mother married another man who is my step dad before my birth) I could only maybe count 4-6 memories total that are positive then it’s just a big blank of neglect and darkness. We were poor and meals were rare unless it was dinner (she at least made dinner once a day for us) I don’t recall much of my stepdad but he was busy working (truck driver) and supporting us while my mother stayed at home for the early years to care for us. (House was generally dirty and I was sometimes made fun of for my clothes appearance and smell) I was able to make friends albeit I’m awkward sort of and they helped a lot to keep me above water.(I made most friends through sports/gym class) my family was generally nice people but a lot of skeletons as some families due.
My relationship to my mother was that of a depressed women who struggles to stay afloat and manage while my relationship to my father was that of terror and abuse, he was very violent and i did fear for my life around him. I told my family at 4 years old that he was physically abusive towards me but when it was investigated I guess they didn’t believe me.(I think my memory is very bad earlier then 10 years old) I do remember him knocking me so hard that everything went black and I woke up later on I’m not sure how long though. My family in general treated me like an outsider(or so it felt and we did celebrate holidays together on either side of the family which were fun)

I'm literally not built for this world.,"I'm not built to live. I'm not built to work, to socialise, to find love or proper friends. I know nothing about how this world works. I know nothing about anything. I have never felt like I should be here, that I was meant to be here. I think I was a mistake, one of the only few humans who were not meant to be here. I dont like people, I don't understand anything about taxes or social security, I know nothing about how anything works. I have tried to make my life better but nothing has been working.

 I remember being younger and thinking into the future and saying to myself that when I reach my early 20's things will be better, I will experience many things. Now I'm 21, my life is 10x worse than I ever imagined. I'm not excited for my future, I don't even have one. I'm just floating around and watching time go by. I have said to myself that my life could change in a few years for the better but I know it's complete bullshit. I said the same thing when I was younger, and I was wrong. I have no future, I have to life. Im basically a worthless, dumb person doing nothing. 

I dont like how this world works. I dont like other people, I don't like societal expectations, I don't like working that much, I don't like money, I don't like current civilisation.

I Feel There Is Nothing Left To Live For,"I have Bipolar Depression, and I just don't think I can beat it. I have OCD and BDD as well and it's hard for me to touch things and I'm so ashamed and upset by how I look. All of this contributes to worse depression. My family has been torn apart and I still live with my parents whom I love very much, but I'm so scared for when their gone. I don't know if I can do this much longer if the depression is going to continue getting worse. I'm scared to die though. What if the religious people are right? I just don't know what to do anymore, but I can't keep feeling like this. The worst part is absolutely the belief I hold that I could have it all: a partner, money, a career and passions that should make me happy, and the Bipolar Depression still makes me feel like absolutely ending it. I just wish I had never been born.

When I was told to kill myself, it left such a bad remembrance but I know I can look past it as I know I won't do anything to hurt her mentally or physically. I've had to change my personal details because of daily harresment I have been receiving to the point of extortion. I'm reaching out to the internet to please help me getting to her that I will literally go to the ends of the earth to make her feel special and appreciated as I know she is not a bad person at heart. I recently bought her a little gift which I hope you will make her feel a tiny bit better and takes her mind of the negative energy she has been having to put up for with. She is the most kind hearted amazing person I've met. She is the most beautiful woman I've ever came across in my life, her smile, her eyes, her giggles all left a scar in my life that I cant see her anymore. Like anybody, she also has flaws but she is perfect for me inside and out. She believed lies from the wrong people which I tried to warn her against. I'm willing to accept any help at this point because I really just want to die having to wake up every morning with the hopes of knowing if she is doing ok.

"I'm only 21, why do I already feel like a failure? This isn't where I wanted to be in my life at all. I'm considering giving up.","It's been a rough four years for me since High School ended. Things were always bad but they never felt this needlessly cruel. Please bear with me if this post is too long. I'll try my best to shave off what's not neccessary, it's hard to fit everything. You don't have to even read the whole thing, I'm suffering for any kind of connection and seeing any sort of reply as to what I can do would help. I tried to segment them into 5 or 6 descriptors to summate what was happening.

 

At 18, things started looking up. I don't make friends often but I like to think when I do, it's because they're people I can develop a *meaningful* friendship with. I found a group pf pals Sophomore year who I still talk to. I started working out more, my grades were a non issue, I was going places and laughing my ass off with my friends and looking forward to finally moving out and going to college. I'm the type of person that does well with people in my corner, otherwise I feel like a lost cause. That's why my grades turned around once I had friends. Had a real ""I can't wait to get out of here"" attitude, my younger self was naive but he had a dream. A future he'd always aspire to, It's what makes me take all the cringy teenager stuff with a grain of salt. Can't say I have that now. 




1)  Heartbreak 

It all started when I foolishly developed feelings for a friend. We knew eachother since kindergarten and slowly started talking more over the years. She knew and kinda teased me about it. She would make jokes about how I had a crush on her and whatnot and we'd both laugh about it. We both had bad home lives and some similar interests. In person, we'd make all types of dumb jokes and sometimes stay up till 3 in the morning texting. Whenever things were bothering her, I always wanted to help. Just seeing her happy was enough. I started working out because of her and although I never got ripped, it gave me some degree of confidence.

All in all, I've moved on and she's become someone who I don't want to talk to anymore. I knew I was a huge idiot simp but at the time I was just happy to talk to someone who I meshed well with. Everyday was an opportunity to see her laugh or what things she would say next. I was really unattractive and had still have low self esteem. She was smart and funny and seemed to light up everyone she came in contact with. We both knew we'd never get together and it's behind me but at the moment it really stung. I've had dumb crushes before but I never actually talked to any of them or knew them as a person, just thought a girl was pretty. I can honestly say she was the first person I've ever loved. For who she was, her mind and her convictions. She's changed now. She ended up dumping her boyfriend of six years for access to hookup sex and drugs. We haven't talked for a long time because I felt the need to walk out of her life and quit causing myself heartache. I was a virgin then, I'm still one now. But I want to be very clear, it's never sex that I wanted, I want to the supportive and fulfilling context a relationship provides. 

2)  Parents

My parents have always been unsupportive. I don't want to blame them too much, there's definitely worse out there and they do what they provide for me, but I definitely can't rely on them for any kind of emotional support or help with my problems. I feel like they don't see me as a person, just a tool. Like a proximal appendage meant to fulfill their own lives. A parent should help their kid understand life and give them the basis of knowledge to operate as a functional member of society, not use them to like a utility. My parents hardly ever teach me anything about how the world worked, like driving or finding a job, and when they do: they're screaming at me and insulting me. I honestly think they don't even want me to have my own life, it's the same thing George Carlin was saying: they just want obedient workers.

They take every chance to belittle, mistreat, guilt trip and manipulate me that they can. If I'm depressed, it's because I'm ""lazy."" My dad had a temper problem when I was growing up, he once smacked me in the side of my arm with the broad side of a machete when I was young because for whatever reason I wasn't picking the weeds the way he wanted. I talked to my counselor at that age about how strict my parents were which of course led child services to our door, after they left my parents continued to find a way to blame this on me. They forced me to go to prom when I made it clear that I was very uncomfortable going to. I had no date and hated the low budget pretentious high school bs. The whole preprom they wanted to show me off like a toy and feed me backhanded compliments so I just talked to my friends instead. All that happened there was my allergic reaction to the food and seeing the girl I liked lock lips with a dude who wasn't me. When the prom bus came back, My parents left me in the freezing rain at 3AM because I was ""disrespectful"" because of course. Stuff like this only ever happens to me. It set this precedent in me, the people I'm told I'm SUPPOSED to trust I can't even rely on.

3) College 1 and Death of Grandma

After that, I graduated. I got a letter from the art school I had applied to. It had closed down and they had to move me into the online division. I already told the other potential schools I applied to that I decided to go to this one and it was too late to renew applications. I was extremely pissed when I got that letter, but my parents didn't exactly seem to care as usual. Online school was the biggest rip off I had ever seen in my life. It was scummy they could charge so much for professors that never responded to emails or graded anything. My grades tanked and I felt used. Kicked around and bullied by greedy corporations wringing me for money I didn't have. February into my freshman year: that entire institution closed nationwide because  they were in that much trouble with the piss poor quality of their classes and tuition.

At the same time as dealing with this econmic stress, my grandmother had gotten very very ill. She was the only person in my family that was always nice to me. She had a blockage in some part of her heart and didn't have very long to live because her age was a death sentence had they ever operated on her. We would stay at her nursing home for hours (which was the most depressing atmosphere on the planet, it smelled like sour fermented fecal matter and death, mostly because that's what you were actually smelling). I missed assignments because of it. I would have to lie to her face and tell her I was doing okay it school. Her funeral was about a week before that online school closed for good so I didn't even get a full year in. During the time leading up to her death, I reached out to all my friends for help. Most of them were supportive. That girl in the first couple paragraphs was always someone who I would talk about life troubles with, both hers and mine. She accused me of being too whiny and to this day that kind of fucked me up. I use apps like ifunny and reddit to vent my problems unironically because I'm scared of people thinking I'm annoying or whiny. I legitimately try to make myself as scarce as possible, so as not to be a bother to anyone. During this time, I remember really trying to improve as an artist, but after I lost my grandmother something in me broke and I couldn't find it in me to draw until after summer ended.


4) 2019

After art school ""ended"" I spent the rest of 2019 until November kind of being a NEET. I lost contact with most of my friends, I tried to find a job at various places only to have my application ignored or fail the interview. I literally have zero work experience even at the time of writing this. I shut in and played video games all day, I didn't even draw like I used to, when I tried I would just hate everything I made. Things were at a low point. Days bled together, I had lost all purpose, sometimes I slept for hours and hours. I woukd play things like Kitchen Nightmares and ASMR for long periods of time just to hear another person talk. The silence was deafening and that silence still follows me around today. I feel like nobody around really cares about me.

Around this time, I stopped working out. My health started to get worse and I gained about 20 pounds.

5) College 2

 I was eventually forced to go back into a community college by my mother, I wasn't really interested in anything other than Psychology and didn't want to do art again. I chose Psych because I was actually half decent at that. In high school, I actually scored a 5/5 on the AP Psychology test thanks to the teachings of an awesome teacher. He was the best teacher I ever knew. He was always visibly excited about his material, he would tell funny annecdotes but always went in depth with discussion of the material, it was already interesting but he elevated it, really made you understood it, commended everyone and applauded them for grasping the concepts. He was the type that genuinely made you believe in yourself. Made you believe he actively thought that you had everything in you you needed to succeed. To this  very day, he's still my role model and who I want to be when I ""grow up."" He once told me that if he had a son, he would want him to be exactly like me. The dude is my hero but I was one of the quiet kids, he wouldn't remember me. When I applied, I was reminded of him and it made me sad. He expressly told us not to apply to this college for whatever reason. At this point, most of my friends were already 2 years in. I worried what he'd think of me if he knew how little I'd accomplished with my life, I still do. I was dragged along on a vacation before college started and it gave me IBS that I only got over recently (about 2 years), even the vacation felt selfish in nature, unconcerned about what I was going through. 

6) College 2 and Covid

This college wasn't ideal but I didn't complain too much. I had a ""it was better than nothing"" and ""its something to do"" stance about the situation. 
I didn't have transportation available so I had to be picked up and dropped off at specific times. So I would be stuck on campus for hours but I didn't mind. There was enough time to get my work done, draw and just laze around watching critical role on my phone. I still missed my friends, I was still bored, felt lost and dissatisfied with life. But honestly, after all I had gone through, it was a sliver of stability after all the things I had been through before. My grades were managable and my parents were off my case. I stayed there for about October 2019 to March 2020 when the pandemic hit. This reverted us back to online learning where my grades suffered, failing 2 classes and my parents railed me for them.

I saw this preemptively and tried to switch to part time and find a first job, but my controlling parents didn't let me. Something about the online format is incredibly frustrating, it's 4x the workload of regular classes yet the teachers never grade anything. It's like death by a thousand cuts. Once you're caught behind, you can't catch up. After my second failed class, my parents threatened to kick me out (during a pandemic too). Luckily, I made the decision to take a smaller number of classes this past semester (4 ---&gt; 5) and got all A's, still the lack of support is killing me. This February I messed up my wrist and thumb with all the snow we get here, and it's paining me since then, making it difficult to draw. I used up alot of money doing occupational therapy and it's still pained. The absolute dickhead of a doctor did nothing for me. With this doctor, I just get this nagging feeling in the back of my head that I'm always annoying someone simply by existing and they're just trying to get over talking to me as soon as possible. He didn't even give me a name for the condition of my wrist. He gave me a form to write about scheduling an MRI, (which I couldn't take because my insurance turned down) HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO WRITE IT WHEN I HAVE A FUCKED UP HAND, IS ANYONE LISTENING TO ME!? YOUR JOB IS TO HELP ME AND YOU DON'T EVEN CARE 

It's managlable now, I can still draw but I can barely make a fist. If something hits it the wrong way, my thumb completely locks up and tightens. I'm praying to Jesus it will heal.

That semester lasted from August 2020 to May 2021. Bringing us to a out where I'm at now in my summer break. I tell people I'm just trying to take it easy but honestly I'm exhausted and have no idea what I'm doing.


7) Present Day

I don't know what I'm doing anymore. My life has never felt this pointless. In four years I've done nothing but fail over and over and over again, banging my head against a wall and bleeding. I want to scream. I want to cry but tears won't come out. I feel like God has abandoned and forsaken me. 

I don't know what I'm here for anymore. I used to fantasize about an idealistic personal future, something everyone does. Dream about having a big house, a beautiful smart wife, two kids and a dog. Something to strive for, keep me going. That only brings me pain now cause Ive given up on that as a possibility. It feels like I'm supposed to fail, that misery in inescapable. That I'm an NPC in a video game and the goal is finding exceedingly contrived reasons for me to kill myself.

I STILL haven't been kissed, found a girlfriend or lost my virginity.

I STILL haven't gotten a job.

I STILL haven't moved out.

I STILL haven't accomplished anything.

Any kind of mobility feels impossible and that the entire universe is so opposed to me that it's actively trying to erradicate me and scatter me to the four winds. Nothing ever works but something always goes wrong.

I'm still around but, man, I'm just running on fumes now with how tiring everything has been for 4 years constantly. I don't want to try anymore. Some part of me eroded away and whats walking forward into a bleak and empty future I hate is just the composite skeleton of what's left of me. Everything I tried to do to better things has blown up in my face, I'm a lost cause a bad investment and tired of trying to fix it.

I wake up everyday and hate the useless, stupid, worthless, hideous, repulsive person I see in the mirror. And engage in a pointless, hapless, miserable, painful life. The only thing that ever seems guaranteed is loneliness and unfulfillment, I feel completely lost and hopeless. I feel so tired of waiting around for things to get better because they're not going to. On a serious note, I'm probably too chickenshit and worthless to even actually attempt suicide but that's yet another thing I fail at. I can't even die right and save everyone the trouble. I don't even know if I want to, but at the end of the day, things won't get better. Everything will only get worse. And still, I'm just gonna get empty platitudes about ""your life is only bad because youre so negative"" like some ""positive attitude"" will magically fix all my problems. I'm  negative BECAUSE of my life. People keep saying to keep trying, but it never changes anyway. Just like everything else, the hours I spent typing this will ultimately lead to nothing but the reality of things is that nobody cares about me, no matter what I do I will never matter.",Onionblood,8,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oc1sg8/im_only_21_why_do_i_already_feel_like_a_failure/,rough four year since high school ended thing always bad never felt

Like right now, I'm listening to ""Last Stop: This Town"" from Eels. It is making me so happy when I can just conceptualize myself in this scenario. Being a fucking ghost leaving my world, taking one last walk through the streets, buildings, various other places I've occupied throughout the years.

"Heh, it gets better, my ass.","So, life has sucked majorly for the past year, and shit just rolls downhill as they say. Earlier last year right around when the pandemic struck I met a special someone who I grew to deeply love, I doubt they knew just how much, and what we had was wonderful, til they pretty much ghosted me for three months or so, and it hurt unfathomably, my heart was wrenched I had fallen in love and they threw it away in favor of whatever else, eventually they messaged me one day out of the blue and wanted to talk, I was hesitant at first, but still loved them, still do to be honest, it never went away. We chatted on and off for a while just the way we used to, surprisingly. They apologized and I accepted, I suppose naively enough, looking back. They then dropped contact again, and at that point I gave up. Fourish? Weeks later they wanted to chat again. I was done at that point, I couldn't keep having myself wrenched around like that. Before they ghosted a second time, I had lost a very close family member, and it just felt like a kick to the face when I didn't have anyone to talk to as openly as I did with them. I hate them for it, and yet love the person I got to know. I hate myself for it too, I shouldn't still love them after all that. But I do. It was a mess when my family member passed, my parents took it hard, particularly my mother, I still lived with my parents at the time, and my mom was sick, getting sicker. The stress wasn't good, ya know? Etc etc. She passed just this last month, and I'm in shambles. I was digging myself out of a hole already, still not over the previous family death, nor the breakup. I guess I'm an idiot for falling in love like that. Just so much shit, where's the good? Where is it? I have nothing left, aside from a job I hate, a mostly empty house, save for my father. I love the man, I do. I can't pretend to know what's going on in his mind, he's probably worse off than I am. But live fucking sucks irregardless. I dunno, honestly. I can go on suffering I suppose. But what's the point? I've been suicidal for years hoping it'd get better and it's only ever gotten worse. I've had periods of good, but even then, just shallow shadows of good, nothing ever lasting or staying, just fading away on the wind.

I feel like Im endangering my family and think it might be better if im gone,"Im feel Im endangering my family and am starting to think its better if Im gone.

Im not contemplating this because Im depressed. (I am, but thats not the reason of this) 

Im a person to suppress emotions. Sadness, anger, i suppress them. It comes out every now and then. I take medications for depression, so sadness isn’t often.  Even then its only late at night and im fine by the morning.

But My anger. Thats what concerns me. Every release, it comes out stronger and stronger. At first its just a pillow punch. Recently its a hole in the wall. And it takes everything i have not to make more or scream at the top of my lungs. I have urges to lash my angers on others. Harm others. I already start to forget things when I get angry. I fear im going to spiral into a blinding anger.  Ive tried anger management. All they say is breath. Or count. It doesnt help.

I know where this anger comes from. 1. Stress. School, trying to live up to my fathers expectations, trying to make sure everyone else is happy, and a few others. Stress makes a portion of my breakouts. 2. Games. Mainly toxic players. They piss me off. Some days Im just not doing well. Or when things arent going the way they are supposed to. Like a quest for a boat race, its incredibly unstable. Cant turn right, but then im facing horizontal. 2 attempts im almost screaming its so stupid. Stop games? Games are  one of my ways to deal with depression. Even with meds it still can flow over. 3. My father. I dont even feel he deserves to be called that.  Sometimes its the lawn. I missed 4 inches of grass with the weed whacker. I get berated. The mower wont start. Its had SO many problems and he knows that. He gets home, it magically starts. Berated because Im damaging it and not using it properly. 

And then there are Jobs. He is impossible. I HAVE to get a job. Ive applied to 7. None responded. He tells me every day ‘call them’ show them you are dedicated and want the job. Otherwise you wont get a job. Every day its in a harsher tone or wording. Now it feels like insults.  He has a construction company, I tried working for a bit. With my brother, right now we are organizing materials and clearing trash. I set an alarm for. 5, missed it, woke at 7, left with brother. Organized, and we went to trash. All wood pallets. We had to lift them up the side of a dump truck. We tried. We couldnt do it. We did other things.

That night, (today) berated again. We are lazy asses because we went late. and we worked wednesday, then didnt thursday because we were dead tired and sore. I said I set an alarm, got yelled cuz Im lying. We CAN lift the pallets. They weigh less than us so we should lift it easily. Anything he can do, so can we. Hes out on sites daily. My brother works at arbys. I dont have a job. We dont lift every day. We CANT lift it. But hes too dense. He grew up on a farm, so he expects us to be able to do everything he could. 

And apparently we dont want jobs. We apply in hopes we dont get them. We are lazy and want to sit around and do nothing. (Thats only the basis but ive forgotten much of it from anger) all this because we went about an hour and a half later and couldn’t lift 80 pound pallets up a vertical surface. And he says he doesnt get much sleep, he’s exhausted, but he does that EVERY DAY. We dont. My sleep schedule is already screwed, I rarely get 4 hours. His response: we are making excuses. We are able to do everything. Because he can.

Im typing this with blood on my knuckles from punching things in my room. My anger is going out of control and I fear I endanger the safety of others.

I know I need help. Therapy is out of the window, they are still virtual and im scared to tell my family. I dont want them to gear this. Not yet. Not i til I can at least learn to calm down. Every time I try to, i get angrier. Music hurts my head. A simple game becomes infuriating.

I need help. But I dont know how to ask.

Im not in a tunnel where suicide is my only option. But its a constant thought that I keep having to push down, only for it to resurface.

Hiding all my mental issues is draining me,"I don’t know how to start. I’m a psychology student, which seems a random thing to start this post with. However, the majority of people assume that due to my study I should be able to help myself with mental issues. Are they stupid? I talked to a professional psychologist a few times, it was horrible. I felt misunderstood, my problems were simplified, and it seemed like a waste of time. I’ve been depressed before, but never as severe as the last few months. As psych student, I of course felt the need to self-diagnose and I assume I’m met some criteria of quiet bpd, including attachment issues, poor emotional regulation, suppressed anger, self-harming, suicidal ideation, eating disorder symptoms, self-blaming when things go wrong, feelings of guilt, and feeling like a burden to others. What makes this a “quiet” syndrome is that I am capable of hiding it from everyone in my life. I live with my parents and I continuously harm myself, purge, and cry myself to sleep. As I said, I feel burdensome so I stopped bothering my favorite person (semi bf) with my problems. Although he has been depressed himself, he wasn’t very understanding when I kept blaming myself during our argument. I feel at loss. I’m hoping for someone to recognize the pain that’s inside of me, I just need to be heard. I don’t have the courage to come forward about my suicidal thoughts because it will shock everyone. My friends and I have lost our mutual best friend when she ended her life, therefore I don’t want to trigger them by exposing them with my unstable mental health. I feel alone. I feel awfully alone.

We got a new one, then my parents got divorced when I was 10. My dad got rid of the dog, and another old dog we had died due to a seizure. My great grandmother passed away when I was 11, and another one of my dogs died. My mom was diagnosed with an extremely rare brain cancer and I haven’t seen her in weeks. We weren’t sure if she would make it. At age 12, my stepsister accused me of sexual assault. I’ve been accused of theft several times. The only time I’ve stolen is my dads beer. And now present day, my uncle just died last night via an overdose on keyboard cleaner. I see no reason to keep trying so I’ll gladly be shooting myself tomorrow night.

pathetic,"I went to the ER two days ago - non-psych related - only to go back home in the morning undiagnosed. My chest still hurts and I'm feeling faint again. I shouldn't have called then and I'm not going to now.
I have taken every opportunity life has granted me and spat it up. I have abused everyone who loves me. There are rats more civil and intelligent than me. I've tried to excuse my behavior, to change it, to prevent action altogether, and nothing has worked. I'm barely human. There is no benefit to my continued existence.
Lying and hiding are my only talents. I can't even commit to death. And here I am now, attention-seeking amidst people who are actually high-risk. The only thing stopping me from committing is the risk of discomfort. I don't care about anyones needs but my own.
I cant be blamed for something this passive. Just hope it's actually an MI/PE/other critical condition.

I'm sorry if my post is boring.,"Well, I'm still learning English so my grammar's suck and I'm sorry for that. I just want to say something to pull it out of my chest. Definitely not gonna work but I just want someone to know it. 
I don't have friend. I want to have one to but I don't have anyone close to me (since I was in kindergarten). I started using social in 2017. I was always lonely and I thought this would help. But seeing people hang out with their friends, looking at their interesting life makes me feel even more lonely. I did have people to talk to but they all left. Every relationship that I had couldn't be lasted for a year. I tried my best to be better, to be funnier and more comfortable to be with but they still drifted away. They found new interests, new friends, they tired of me or we just weren't as close as I thought. I think I deserve this. Maybe being friend with me for too long can drag them down. But it still hurts. It's so painful. I'm not really sure what happened but I'm sure that it was my fault. They never was the one who texted first, if I didn't do that, noone would text me. Even though I tried my best but the replies were shorter everyday until one day they left me on seen. I still keep my hope up for years and now the hope just vanished.
I befriended with a girl recently. I knew her in the August of 2020. I reminded myself not to keep my hope up because everything will be the same. But I also force myself to trust her and believe in my faith. ""Maybe it will be better this time"" — I thought. But apparently, this curse hasn't gone yet. The last thing I hoped to come is right back. Always the one who text first, always wait for the messages might not exist in the first place and really want to ask if she gets tired of me just to think she might try to be nice so I won't get an honest answer. I'm pathetic, I know, but I'm too scare of being alone so I'm clinging on nothing to trick myself that I'm wrong. 
I never had the chance to get close to her. I only want to have a best friend and that's all. I want to die, I know that people in this sub reddit all want to die one way or another. I just thought that if I could feel less lonely, I could have more motivation to live. If there is God, I don't think that he wants me to be happy, he loathe me so much that he makes me this miserable. I have other problems too so at least God please let me have conversations with others without thinking they feel awkward talking to me and they will all leave me behind like this.

So depressed that getting high doesnt even sound good to me anymore,"I usually get so high I won't feel anything but happiness but today I woke up with a pit in my stomach and a hole in my chest so big that even the thought of the happiness weed brings doesnt patch up what's killing me inside. 

Ya know what's worse? I always hated my last name. I could never understand why. Through therapy Ive had memories being dug up only to find that my parents abused me so heavily that 80% of my childhood is a blank. I can't even remember some of the good times. 

I decided to was going to change my last name, only for Cali to change their price. It was once only around 200 bucks to change your name and they upped it to almost 500. 

It's like the universe telling me I was never worth anything, I was born to shitty parents who tried to sell me for drugs. Only to be tossed into an abusive home by people who claimed they wanted a child only to abuse the child for years and years. Than I get out and just keep being abused. I'll never be able to escape.

"I was all the way up, and now I'm all the way down again","5 years ago I was 22, living with my parents. I had dropped out of school because my mental health was a disaster, and I had run out of money. I had gotten a job, but I didn't make a ton and I was drinking and doing drugs on the daily.

4 years ago, I had moved out of my parents' place. I finally found a therapist I could work with. She encouraged me to start medication. I was still struggling a lot emotionally, but I was making progress in a direction. I had a group of friends. I had side projects and hobbies. I was not in a relationship, but  I was meeting people and doing things.

3 years ago, I felt ""human"" for the first time, maybe ever. I had been working with my therapist for a long time, I had medication that helped, I had a job that was interesting and engaging, and I was working on building good and healthy habits.

2 years ago, I was in a position to move across the country for a job that I really wanted, and I did. I had a new relationship and a job that I loved, and for the first time since I was a kid I felt happy and confident. I was confident enough to go off of my medication. I felt like I had finally made something of myself and was in a good place emotionally.

1 year ago, I had a different job and an unhealthy, emotionally unsafe, and failing relationship. I was working 80 hours per week and then spending my weekends helping my SO take care of her apartment and her pets.

6 months ago I had gotten fired and was yet again at a different job, and there was no more relationship.

5 months ago, the last close relationship in my life started slowly dying. My sibling came out as trans and while I absolutely love them and support them, it took a serious toll on our relationship - they began focusing almost exclusively on their new identity and community, and only wanted to talk about themselves and their new life. This was the only other person on the planet I could talk to about the emotional baggage caused the house we were raised in for 2 decades, and they wanted to put all of that behind them and kill off that version of themselves. Our regularly scheduled activities fell by the wayside as they got more involved with the people their newfound community, and our relationship naturally drifted apart. I was a thousand miles away, they were busy with a new identity and new friends.

4 months ago, I wanted to kill myself. I had been spiraling prior to that, and I was struggling to perform at work. I was exhausted constantly, and irritable. I was fired for the second time in 4 months. Doing basic things like feeding myself was a massive emotional and physical lift. I was completely alone, jobless, and stuck in an expensive city I didn't want to be in anymore.

3 months ago, I moved back into my parents' house. The same house and same parents that I've spent years in therapy trying to understand and heal from.

I'm 27 now. Over the last 3 months, I've fallen deeper and deeper into a suicidal depression. Last week I finally broke the wall and put together a plan. I got the stuff together and figured out time and place to end my own life. I am devastated. I hate that I feel this way, but I really think the pandemic and the lockdown ruined my life. It happened at such an unexpected and inopportune time, and has lasted *so* long. The world is in chaos, it was 118 degrees in the arctic circle this week, I'm trapped in a place that I hate and can barely function as a human being.

I really can't see the point. I don't deserve good things - they don't happen to me. When I hurt, I end up making the people around me hurt, in on way or another. I feel like I can't do this anymore. I just want to close my eyes and never wake up. There are things that are wrong with me emotionally that I don't even know where to begin fixing.

I wish I had a terminal illness like cancer so that I have an excuse to die.,"I always want to die but I stop myself because I feel guilty. I know it’s bad and and awful thing to say but I feel like if I had a terminal illness like cancer I wouldn’t feel guilty committing suicide. I would have a reason to die, in the eyes of my friends and family. I wouldn’t have ‘suddenly’ died. I can blame something that everyone understands. No one will say ‘why didn’t you seek therapy’ ‘you could’ve told me about how you were feeling’. I guess all life is terminal since we die one day, I just want to die a bit earlier. 

I really hate myself for thinking like this. And I hate that small things trigger these thoughts. Like when my friends or cousins meet without me and go somewhere without me. Or when I’m locked out of my house and have to walk around till someone else comes home. I don’t know why these situations trigger me but they do and I hate myself for it. Explaining my mental health is a burden on both myself and my family and friends since no one gets it unless they have it. I already feel like a burden so no point in further pushing it. At least with cancer I won’t have to explain and they’ll just get it that ‘oh she died because of cancer’.",NushrinSK,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/obxjv3/i_wish_i_had_a_terminal_illness_like_cancer_so/,always want die stop feel guilty know bad awful thing say feel like terminal illness like cancer feel guilty committing suicide would reason die eye friend family suddenly died blame something everyone understands one say seek therapy could told feeling guess life terminal since die one day want die bit earlier really hate thinking like hate small thing trigger thought like friend cousin meet without go somewhere without locked house walk around till someone else come home know situation trigger hate explaining mental health burden family friend since one get unless already feel like burden point pushing least cancer explain get oh died cancer,wish terminal illness like cancer excuse die,1178,76

I’m a 23 year old woman and I want to kill myself. I’m not gonna pretend like I have it worse than anyone else and I’m not gonna say that I have a better reason than anyone else to kill myself. I really don’t. I come from a wealthy family, have an American Express card that I don’t pay the bills for, I get told I’m beautiful and get a lot of attention from men, I have an incredible boyfriend, I live alone in a really luxurious apartment in the most expensive place to live in America, I have a job in STEM and got a raise that brought me to 6 figures, I don’t know anybody my age that has the world at her fingertips like I do. As a little girl this was the life I wanted. So why the fuck do I still want to die. Why have I always wanted to die. 

Everyone thinks wanting to kill yourself is about hating your life. I honestly have an incredible life and I’m so fucking grateful for those that have provided it to me, and I feel incredibly and disgustingly and unbearably guilty for wanting to be dead. But the truth is, this shit doesn’t excite me. Want money? Take mine. Want literally anything I have that you don’t? Take it. I don’t care about it, I really don’t give a fuck about anything.

-,"it's the last day of the term today.

sometime during the holidays i want to go to sleep and just not. wake up

because i'm scared of pain and that's why i want to leave this world, i want to stop hurting from all of life's grievances. every little thing. like the fact that no one invited me to go to the city after we finished (early) so i just went home instead, or the fact that my sister hates me for no reason and now she acts like she would prefer if i were dead, or that expectations make me want to scream and die, or that i got an a instead of an a plus and other people did better or the fact that sicne i'm asexual there's no point of me being here on earth.

it'd be way easier if i could just sleep forever. i walk home from school everyday after catching two buses and cross a road with six lanes. it would be nice if i could stop in the lane    but there's pain, and the possibility of survival.  it's clear that no one cares for me so what's the point of going out with a bang? if i could just disappear from people's lives and fade away like nothing, because i *am* nothing that would satisfy me.

i've always wanted to know what it's like after death. 

it's so hard to put my thoughts into text  because it makes so much more sense inside my head. 

ii can't cope with all this how do those people in the novels get throughh high school while simultaneously being in five extracurriculars and getting laid? i'm definitely not popular - not even at the point where i'm a theatre kid or play d&amp;d. fuck i don't even know how to play d&amp;d lmfao

i've read that overdosing is painful if you don't do it right. but there's nothing else i can possibly kms with in my house. it's australia, there are no guns. 

when i think about killing myself i feel better, more calm

when i think about death i feel better. if it were possible for me to give my life to someone who wanted to live but couldn't, i'd do it in a heartbeat.

fked,"as a opener im not really in urgent danger. and for context I have ADHD, ocd, and autism.

ive been in a loop at starting work at 8pm, working till 2-3am, and not getting enough done. my productivity is expected to increase because im on the 2nd edition of my pip. i have 200 done right now out of 510 (I have do more than one task every minute, and increase every week, for my productivity goal). 

im suicidal because i read this book called “never be late again, 7 tips for the punctually challenged.” the 7 reasons are hurtful. there’s denial that being late is bad, denial over how much time something will take, denial over how to get motivated, denial over being able to “have it all” etc. The book constantly says that your friends hate it when you’re late. That you’re just undisciplined and just need to make a schedule and stick to it to build discipline. But then just tells you how to make the schedule but gives no guidelines on how to actually do what you’ve planned.

Anyway. The book says “discipline is the foundation of all the exercises.” And I wrote “well looks like I’m going to fail.” And then I read it all anyway instead of working, sobbing hysterically now at doing less than half of my work for the day at 1:30am. 

All of the schedules in the world won’t fucking stop me from procrastinating. Medicine. Amphetamines. SSRIs. APs. Thousands in therapy. Books. Physical beatings as a child. It took financial abuse for me to get my college degrees. It took psychological abuse for me to not give up for fear of disappointing my parents. I still live at home. My room is a mountain of trash. I haven’t showered in a week. 

I can’t show weakness to my boss otherwise I’ll get fired. All I had to do was work a normal 40 hour workweek from home and I can’t even fucking do that. My boss is going to be so fucking disappointed. I’ll get fired. I’ve been trying to find a job but I look at one job app and then take a 4 hour break. The same thing happens to me at work btw. I do 1 thing and then I take a 4 hour break. It’s asinine. I can’t stop. I just need to cut myself. Maybe that will work. Did it work before? I don’t remember.

Childhood bullying never goes away,"I definitely have it a lot better than some of the others on this board, but I've been going through a very rough patch. For context, I'm an introverted 19-year-old Asian male with mild autism. Combined with being 5'7/45kg and being a late-bloomer, my formative experiences were nearly exclusively of rejection and bullying. I used to be a very smart kid destined for Ivy leagues (perfect ACT at 14, top 5 in the state at math and chess, etc.) until being ostracized in high school ruined me. After being publicly flamed for my squeaky voice and being called ""chink/jap/faggot/virgin"" during sophomore year, I dropped out of school and did nothing but play video games in the basement for four years.

I completed my GED and have two years of college credit under my belt from APs and attending community college, but the prospect of taking university classes in person next fall terrifies me. I hate being a short, awkward minority, and I wanna put a bullet through my skull for not going to CA or NY for school, where I at least wouldn't have to deal with racial struggles. Every tall white guy I see on the street reminds me of my high school bullies. I want so desperately to spend my life with a nice girl, but my past experiences have deprived me of all confidence. My greatest source of self-esteem hardly comforts me anymore; who knows if I'll even make as much as some idiot former HS bully with better social skills. **I was born in a world where my strengths don't matter and my shortcomings are doubly penalized.**

""Just lift, bro."" Haha, I wish. I certainly would if I weren't a repressing trans woman. I chose to repress because I don't wanna force myself into a life of oppression/loneliness and because I'll never develop the traits that would most strongly trigger dysphoria (balding, body hair, wide shoulders, etc.). I'm still doing cardio and playing ping pong just to stay healthy, but I don't like the shredded look.

I'm trapped in a cycle of anger and guilt for being resentful of my parents. I didn't have it that bad; they weren't abusive and they cared for me. I just fucking wish they didn't let me slip so hard. They're such carefree religious nutjobs who think ""god will make everything okay."" Why didn't you encourage me to study for olympiads during my NEET days? Why didn't you tell me to work out more? Why didn't you stop me from sleeping on my stomach and losing an inch to posture? Why are you against me crossdressing because ancient primitives said it was an abomination against their magic sky wizard? It's not like you're gonna be grandparents anyway. Thanks for blaming me for my problems, dad, you're the one who gave me the autism and raised me in a 3% Asian state.

I also feel depressed thinking about the life that was stolen from me. I'll never experience the feeling of accomplishment from reaching my full academic potential. I'll never experience messing around town at night with my friends. I'll never experience skipping stones by the lake with my high school sweetheart. I'll never experience the feeling of being loved.

I'm probably the reason why my father is dying right now,"Let me start by saying that this is the closest I've ever been to actually considering killing myself. This is my story. I don't write well and I do apologize for this text.

I'm (30M) an immigrant (not going to disclose country), and I left my home, parents, and two siblings about four years ago (2017), to live with my current wife and to study engineering. I have graduated about two years ago and it was the best and the worst time of my life.

Two years ago, my father (59M) was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, a very aggressive type of brain cancer. At the same time, I was applying to renew my immigrant status and I couldn't leave the country since COVID-19, and everything was pretty much shutdown. Going back to my country was a big no, since It would fuck up my status. My mom and siblings, were the ones that actually did everything and helped him deal with cancer.

My father's first surgery was on the right side, and didn't affect him much. His doctor removed pretty much all that was possible, and he started the traditional chemo + radiotherapy treatment. At this time, my father was more alive than ever, he started fishing, exercising, and he even enrolled in some architecture classes (learning more about AutoCad and etc). My father had a lot of trouble dealing with AutoCad, and I offered him some help. We started sharing screens using Teams and he was not following up the step by steps. We had a lot of connectivity issues as well, always disconnecting, stuttering, losing audio and etc.

This is where I started with my stupid shit. I didn't realize that he was enjoying spending the time with me, and he wasn't giving to shits about AutoCad. However, I wanted him to excel and get his certification, so I would get very upset with him.

Fast forward 6 months, and his third MRI shows a huge mass on his left side, and two small masses close to cerebellum. He does his second surgery, much more aggressive. Now, he barely walks, he probably speaks three words a day, can't understand much, needs constant supervision, and I just had to help my mom clean him. 

I'm such a POS and probably the one that caused the cancer to spread, because I was fucking ranting about AutoCAD. I was finally able to come home to help my family this month. No need to say that my whole family is broken because of this fucking disease. 

I think this is my short story, the only thing holding me from actually pulling the trigger rn is my dad, which is probably sleeping in the other room.

I think my message is to not let small things upset you, because you might never hear an ""I love you"" ever again.

Feel like my brain is split in two,"The past couple months have been really difficult with suicidal thoughts and intense thoughts of self harm. What's worse is that I'm in a limbo at the moment where I hate that I'm suicidal because I know there must be a part of me that doesn't want to die (or at least hates all the painful imagery in my head everyday) but the other part of me is completely set on just getting up and out of this life one way or another.

I hate that I won't be able to get proper help until the day before my birthday later in July, when it's a struggle to even promise to myself to even make it that far down the line.

My parents are expecting me to get better, but I think its just because now that they're aware of the bare minimum of my issues right now they think that because I can sit and talk and wash the dishes and walk the dog that I'm not eternally feeling like I'm 5 minutes from going to the nearest train track and just waiting to be taken out that way.

I can't help feeling guilty and weak about everything in my life, and I'm now nearly 26 and I can't bear that I've already had to go through this cycle time and time again this past decade.

Suicide shall reduce my best friend burden,"TL:DR - I was born with with Autism and depression. Made a bestest friend in my life that made people think we are couples, lost the friend due to unknown reasons. 0.5-1 month later her relationship started. Friendship was even worse after their relationship have broken and now we're not friends anymore. Got blocked, or unfollowed everywhere. My gift for her early birthday got rejected. Can't get over, planned to die. 

[If the situation is resolved, this post will be deleted. If I have fully commited to suicide, I will delete this post too. Also, throwaway account to prevent my close ones from getting affected.] 

I'm sick of life, I'm sick of being nice. I can't bring myself to do something bad or revengeful, so I guess I'll just suicide. Friends find solving my situation a burdern. I lost what feels everything to me. I can't wait to suicide on my best friend (as I still do see her as) birthday (which maybe maybe happens to be tomorrow. I don't know if I would have decided by then.). I'm ready to be cancelled by the world. 

To be honest, I'm considered somewhat successful, in a fortunate country, in a higher than average income family. Unable to appreciate what I have, first world problems, am I right?


[Some irrelevant stuff]
I'm a selfish prick, I hate my family, I don't care about them. I get it, they raised me, I apologise I can't appreciate things. 

[Background]
I was born with Autism and I have depression, and was depressed for about my whole life. Even though happy things occured, I for some reason can't be not depressed. I only overcame depression temporarily because of my bestfriendship with Beverly (whom will be introduced later). 

[Pre-story]
I'll just share a stereotypical bestfriendship to feeling suicidal story. Just note that I have attempted suicide 3 times before 3 years ago (before 2018) 

There are 2 main people in this broken fairytale. Me and the fake name I shall call Beverly. Maybe at times in this post I'll call her B or something. 

Main - Myself [M] &amp; Beverly [F]
Side - Daisy [Beverly (also) best friend,] [F], Cassie (Beverly ex-girlfriend, LGBT) [F] 

[Main: Pre-relationship Era, 2018 May - 2019 Dec]
Beverly and I started to talk through some scholarship interview. These made us friends, and we became great friends after a few exchanges. I also made friends with Daisy, introduced through Beverly. Since my class only have 6 girls which consist 2 Malay and 4 Chinese and that the malays are 1 group and the chinese are split to 2 groups due to different age groups, Beverly and Daisy are always together alone in the class as the duo (and also the fact that they are shy too). Thus, since I didn't like to see small lonely groups/individuals, I decided to make an effort to talk to them. 

As time goes by, I decided to offer help on many modules, we exchange talks. Months later, Beverly, Daisy and I became bestfriends. Beverly and I were even closer bestfriends. This was the best friendshio in my life. Infact, many classmates looked at us and thought we were a couple. But of course we're not. I never thought of wanting to have a girlfriend. Don't like the thought of someone to suffer with my autistic mental illness and just don't like responsibilities. Anyways, I'm fat with a BMI of 34.5. I'm unattractive to her. 

To tell you how great the bestfriendship between Beverly and I was,
1: Beverly was the first friend to ever come to my house. I never liked ever having visitors to my house
2: We liked to poke each other.
3: We say a lot of random stuff, we sing in discord...
4: We allowed each other to lie on each other shoulder
5: We took pic together everytime the trio went out.
6: I became so willing to help her meet her course deadlines, even if it meant to burn the midnight oil.
7: Sending &lt;3 to each other many times, protraying that we loved each other as friends.
8: We even have secret instagram accounts dedicated to each other.
9: We video called in discord almost everyday, to sometimes even as late as 4am. Yes, we were insanely crazy. 

Fun fact: I was the first guy close friend to Beverly apparently. 

Everything about this friendship was so positive until...


[Main: Relationship Era 2019 Dec - 2021 Jan]
One day, she stopped. Beverly suddenly stopped doing the usual we do. I asked her whats wrong and I was shut from her. Unfortunately, till this day, I have no idea why our usual bestfriendship stopped completely. (When you read later on, I can confirm that it isn't because of the relationship with Cassie) 

About half a month to a month later, her relationship with Cassie started. In such a country that does not support LGBT, you can imagine how scary it is. Majority of the parents would also disapprove and might/will disown their children for being an LGBT or get scolded like hell. So it took her courage before she could tell me that her relationship existed (first and only one to know it that time. I had my suspicion she have a relationship, just not the LGBT) and that she couldn't do the things we used to do anymore so that Cassie won't get jealous, and that Beverly cannot focus a friendship and a relationship at the same time. I tried my best to understand, even though it hurts that the bestfriendship in my life is just gone... like that. I honestly didn't like that a relationship affected my bestfriendship with her. (See the 9 points I mention about how great my bestfriendhsip with Beverly was? All gone. There was no argument, there was no tension, nothing. Just all gone.) 

As their relationship went on, her friendship with Daisy and many other close friends (all girls) deteriorated. Her friends noticed that Beverly acted so different, and no longer chat as often as she usually be. 

On around 2019 Nov - Dec, her relationship with Cassie worsened, often having arguments that are irrelevant to this (TL:DR; I miss you, covid sucks, restriction sucks, can't meet up;etc), and that because of how this country society exist in treating LGBT, they think they can never be together. At this point, she shared to me her relationship issue and how she felt lonely, so I finally decided that I should help her regain her friendship with her close friends and Daisy back, in which I told her to just tell the truth, have just a nice talk. We teenagers/Young Adults surprisingly are okay with LGBT. In the end, simoly talking to her friends at the emotional midnight timing helped to recovered her friendships back to normal... except for me because ours was ended as bestfriendship before the relationship with Cassie occured. 

Anyways I always told her to continue her relationship, because I believed one day society will change since many of us young adults have been trying to petition to change some of the country laws towards LGBT. 

As per usual, this whole time, even though our bestfriendship stopped, I still continue to help her in studies with the midnight oil as much as I can, accompany her in games;etc. 

As the relationship got worse and Beverly kept telling me of how much she felt hurt, I told her she should really break up. She really sounded like she was abused and my heart really couldn't take it. Trust me, I didn't want her to break up because I knew she was so happy. She also didn't want to break up, but the mental toll got to her. 

[Main: Post-relationship Era Jan 2021 - Now]
The breakup happened. Cassie initiated the breakup with Beverly and was stern on not talking to each other ever again. Honestly, I respected their relationship because I saw how Cassie made Beverly really happy, so even though I was sad the bestfriendship is gone, I was happy that Beverly was really happy. But breakup? It really made me feel depressed, even though it sounded like it meant I can get my bestfriendship back, because I never seen Beverly this sad before. Initially I really wanted my bestfriendship back, but after I realise she needed time to heal, I decided to let it go and just waited for months. (Note: This meant that I'm partially responsible for making them break their relationship because I partially influenced Beverly's decision) 

Months later, at April, I know she still missed Cassie. I can't blame her. So, I decided to do the crazy. I talked to Beverly about how she felt, and all she wanted was answers from Cassie, on whether she was serious if the broke up was really because of disinterest.. and a couple of other questions. Beverly said that if she could get answers to her question, she would overcome and let go of the relationship. While in my heart, I feel pain, I also have a tiny sense of hope that our bestfriendship could return. So I did the crazy and talked to Cassie. Note: This is the first time I talked to Cassie; EVER. Cassie originally was somewhat reluctant to answer, but it took a month of helping Cassie in Cassie's course study that I managed to convince Cassie to try to answer all of Beverly's questions. 

On the day of graduation, Cassie answered only some of the questions, and the reply were mundane and felt like it didn't answer to Beverly's questions. So, Beverly said that I did enough and just tried to move on. At this point, its been 2 years since my bestfriendship was gone. I really missed it, and could never understand why Beverly didn't miss at all, likely to be overshadowed by her relationship. 

June, things got even worse. My friendship with Beverly worsened, and I was accused of stalking her, especially when I get so confused and curious as a person who sees her as a bestfriend still of why she kept offlining and onlining her status, and to determine if she is really offline by using other social media platform she shares her last seen/online status. One day, she told me to stop fucking stalking and blocked me on Telegram, and I told her that she went too far, kicked (not ban) her out of my super private discord server that only had me, her and someone else out of frustration and then she blocked me on all messaging applications, and unfollowed/blocked/unfriended all social media account except for 1. 

I was really hurt. Badly hurt that our friendship went from perfection to just.. I dunno. 

I got even more hurt when I realised her old self still existed when she talked to Daisy. She's just treating this way towards me. 

I prepared a birthday gift that is worth around $200.. the second birthday gift I ever prepared for anyone and somewhat most expensive gift, as also an apology that I didn't gift to her for 3 years despite us as bestfriends/friends (though to be fair she said my exustence was a gift last time hahahaha. She and Daisy gifted me once in 2020 too!). 

Unfrotnately, when I met her in real life to gift her the present early because she needed a parcel from me since she ordered something that delivers to my house, she rejected my gift. I was completely devasted. I begged her to accept my gift and she didn't. Furthermore, now she won't even respond to me. Her friendship that I helped her fixed was all fine.. just me. 

At this point, its already official that I lost my bestfriend who made me went out for depression for 2 years. I tried to gift but was even rejected. I was hoping she accepted the gift and then I can maybe finally move on a little, but nope. 

To me, she was everything. She made me so happy. It really hurts to see all these gone. Why must good things end? There wasn't any conflict, nothing bad happened and then things suddenly changed. 

I'm just so tired of life, tired of living. I'm just really tired. I really just want to suicide. I'm just so sick that all the time I spent in the relationship felt like it's gone. Maybe I am the asshole for being stalkish and questioning whh she goes fake offline. Maybe if she just wants me dead now. If I suicided, maybe she will be happier. Afterall, my this year birthday wish was about hoping she will be happy and remain happy in life. 

I don't deserve to live. Maybe I'm just evil. Anyways I'll have maybe a few days or less before I decide to suicide or not. I feel really alone now. I can't possibly share this to any friends. Anyways they will think its none of their business anyways... 

Fun fact: Beverly promised a hug pre relationship era, never gotten one unfortunately. Secretly just wanted the hug now to really feel much better about life. 

Please note: Even though I made it sound like Beverly is evil, rest assured that she used to support me, comfort me, accompanied me. She's really a kind hearted person but just shy and not so academically smart.
Do NOT attack anyone. I will feel more compelled to kill myself earlier if one of these members gets attacked. 

I do not want to talk to online people, I tend to despise them because most of them took my real life friends away. I know not all or not even many online people are like that. But I just felt I needed to share the pain before I really decide to die. 

[Ending]
You know, now that I think of it, maybe I didn't do enough for her... and that I'm just someone with a sick and shitty attitude 

Sigh, can't believe after all these... all the journeys we've been through, we're no longer friends... but no matter what, I still see you as my best friend,

I am no longer suicidal after a decade (but still want to die),"the majority of my life has been suicidal thoughts, and I have had strong thoughts of hanging myself for awhile

although something has happened where I don’t feel entirely conscious in this world, I already feel like I hit the lowest point in my life and I have nothing to lose for being alive, when I will die eventually anyways and the sun will explode. nothing will really matter
so now I feel like my existence is just a ‘blip’ and sleeping feels so good
even if I am struggling badly, I don’t feel any pull for being dead or alive? because I no that no matter the amount of pain I feel, it will eventually end and I die, no matter how severe the pain is? 

I just feel completely disconnected from this world, like I could disintegrate at any second, and that if I really wanted to I could end it in any point in my life. but I just hold it at that

i don’t feel any intense pain to escape this reality. i neither see it as hell or heaven anymore. it’s just life. and i’m going to die, have no children

i never imagined not being suicidal but i think i finally am and can’t grasp that i am no longer suicidal but i still want to die and have struggles. but i’m not going to 

it’s the same kind of peace where you decide to end your life but somehow i have managed to have that even when i know i may not die anytime soon

It doesn’t seem like it will ever get better. Its just an endless cycle and I can’t get out of it and everyone’s so sick of it now and I can tell. I don’t want to be here anymore at all.

My dad just told me to eat shit and die because I didn't immediately accept his apology for two seconds earlier when he told me to fuck off because I was tired and wanted to go to bed. I'm a teenager but he really fucking acts like one, freaking out at his parents and having outbursts for no reason even though he's the one who still lives with them at 40 years old. I'm worthless and stupid and shitty. I must be, right? If I wasn't, and I was actually good, why would my parents hate me so much? Why would I have such incredibly bad depression? Why would I constantly feel like I want to die? Good people have to deal with things like that all the time, but at least, if I'm a good person, people will remember me that way. At least we live by a busy road.

i dont know anymore,"I don't get what's wrong with me.

I'm 21 years of age, I'm from Germany and am a male.
I have been depressed for many years, never rlly had a reason.
2 years ago, when I was about to go into 12th grade I was super stressed about school.
We went to Malta in a small group to learn diving and got a license, I never felt better in life.
I was surrounded by people I didn't know, but everyone was instantly like family, I didn't have anything to worry about, I felt free, like I could do everything I wanted, I stood on my own feet, wevwent diving every day for the week we were there.

I never had any friends.
In kindergarden I only had my cousin, he moved before I went to school, I barely stayed in contact with him.
I was never the fastest in school, the teachers were the first to give up on me.
Second grade I had my first real friend, our moms knew each other since our birth, I was a few months older then him, he was a quiet kid, he also didn't have any other friends, and that didn't change for the next few years for both of us.
Third grade was he'll for us, the new teacher didn't like us, you could just tell, learned later that the teacher wasn't good anyway, she got fired a bit after we graduated 4th grade. A bit into third grade our parents heard about a private school that's getting build from the ground up with a promising concept, that's when we changed to that school, we helped build it, it was lead by parents who tried teaching us we did actually have one teacher she was great, she rlly believed in us.
She got fired a few weeks in because she didn't wanna stick to the concept. We left that school not long after and went back to third grade in out old school, but with a little twist, we did not get put in the same class again, we were separated and I was put in a completely different class where I knew noone.
I redid the third grade and went on to school grades 5-10. Again, my awful teacher managed to put me in new class again, this time, with all the students you don't wanna be enemies with.

The years went by and I managed to keep my head out of drugs alcohol and other crap, I made friends in the class over, I still am friends with those two.

Quick explanations,
You are bad in school and only do 9 years = secondary school diploma

You are average and do 10 years = secondary school leaving certificate

You are good and do 10 years but with a good grade point avarage = extended secondary school leaving certificate.

I managed to actually get the extended secondary and went on to High school.

While all that was happening, at some point my mom had a kidney failure and is on dialysis, that was about 8 years ago I think, and her condition was getting worse each year to the point where she can barely walk up the stairs anymore. My dad has a full-time job as a chef and comes home late, and when he's home, he is infront of his computer.

I never rlly felt that much love from my family, sure they love me and all, but everything else is more important.

Anyway, I'm in high school and the stress is picking up, I manage it a bit but my grades decline, queue the trip to Malta, I'm feeling freed, never felt better, I come back home, suddenly, straight F's, I can't remember anything anymore, simple equation just gone, I feel overwhelmed, I have existential questions, what do I do, what can I even do with my life now? I contemplate suicide, again... this time not just because I'm sad. One day in school, a exam again, straight F. I tell the teacher I'm not to well, um going home, I'm on the bus, burst into tears, I arrive home and walk the longest mile to our house I have ever walked, I open the door, walk up the stairs, not making a sound, my mother laying in the kitchen on the bench, exhausted, I walk up to her, she sits upright, looks me in the eyes and gives me a hug, I can't stop crying for what felt like 10 minutes, I tell her I thought about killing myself, I need help. That's when we contacted the psychiatrist or therapist or whatever.
All went well and I got better, had a drawback when my uncle died, which rlly impacted our family and still does to this day, a year later, he lived next door and now we got to pay that house too, and because germany is a hell of paperwork, a year later we still have lots of problems with it.

I turn 21 in a few days and last month I left therapy, we thought everything was fine again, I'm going back to school, a different way this time, something that fits me better and is not as much in school and more job related, but since even before I left therapy I felt empty, I wasn't okay, I wanted to be. but I wasn't.

So here we are now, I have not a reason to be sad, have not a reason for depression, nothing in my way but still, I want to take my live, I have never thought bad about it, in my had I go through many ways I could end it, many ways I could have killed X person in Y ways, I could have saved the school from a shooting, I could have shot up the school.

I harmed myself, but I didn't feel anything, it didn't help me, I stopped doing it shortly after.

I'm filled with joy and happiness someday, and I'm empty most days.
I like getting hugged
but I never get hugged
I like telling jokes
but I have no one that listens
I like writing poetry
but I scrap it every time (actually did that here too, this whole thing was poetic once) 
Kaffeemaschine (yes, autocorrect gets it) 

I just want a normal life, I don't want to worry about suddenly having the urge to kill myself. I don't want to feel emotions that don't have a reason to be, I feel guilty for things I haven't done, I feel sad about things that never happened. 
I miss people I never knew, I crave loneliness but hate being alone. 

I have tried to get help, they helped me.
But I still feel the way I do.
I never tried suicide because I habe people that care. and I did care about them, but I'm loosing my grip on all of it, sure I now know the reason to keep living, I know that people love me, I know I have chances and can do whatever I like.

but. I don't want to.

I don't want enter the doors that open, when others close. I stopped caring about people.

I don't deserve to end it
I don't want to end it

but I also don't want it to keep going.
Everyone around me things that this bit of therapy changed me, and so did I. But it only removed the big stones that path my way, the holes are still there, and I fall down the holes constantly.
Im now just waiting for the perfect moment where I snap and nothing makes sence anymore, because I can't do it now, my purpose is only to survive each day on its own until the point comes where I can't.",burnersad56,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oc39lt/i_dont_know_anymore/,get wrong 21 year age germany male depressed many year never rlly reason 2 year ago wa go 12th grade wa super stressed school went malta small group learn diving got license never felt better life wa surrounded people know everyone wa instantly like family anything worry felt free like could everything wanted stood foot wevwent diving every day week never friend kindergarden cousin moved went school barely stayed contact wa never fastest school teacher first give second grade first real friend mom knew since birth wa month older wa quiet kid also friend change next year u third grade wa u new teacher like u could tell learned later teacher good anyway got fired bit graduated 4th grade bit third grade parent heard private school getting build ground promising concept changed school helped build wa lead parent tried teaching u actually one teacher wa great rlly believed u got fired week wanna stick concept left school long went back third grade old school little twist get put class separated wa put completely different class knew noone redid third grade went school grade 5 10 awful teacher managed put new class time student wanna enemy year went managed keep head drug alcohol crap made friend class still friend two quick explanation bad school 9 year secondary school diploma average 10 year secondary school leaving certificate good 10 year good grade point avarage extended secondary school leaving certificate managed actually get extended secondary went high school wa happening point mom kidney failure dialysis wa 8 year ago think condition wa getting worse year point barely walk stair anymore dad ha full time job chef come home late home infront computer never rlly felt much love family sure love everything else important anyway high school stress picking manage bit grade decline queue trip malta feeling freed never felt better come back home suddenly straight f remember anything anymore simple equation gone feel overwhelmed existential question even life contemplate suicide time sad one day school exam straight f tell teacher well um going home bus burst tear arrive home walk longest mile house ever walked open door walk stair making sound mother laying kitchen bench exhausted walk sits upright look eye give hug stop cry felt like 10 minute tell thought killing need help contacted psychiatrist therapist whatever went well got better drawback uncle died rlly impacted family still doe day year later lived next door got pay house germany hell paperwork year later still lot problem turn 21 day last month left therapy thought everything wa fine going back school different way time something fit better much school job related since even left therapy felt empty okay wanted reason sad reason depression nothing way still want take live never thought bad go many way could end many way could killed x person way could saved school shooting could shot school harmed feel anything help stopped shortly filled joy happiness someday empty day like getting hugged never get hugged like telling joke one listens like writing poetry scrap every time actually whole thing wa poetic kaffeemaschine yes autocorrect get want normal life want worry suddenly urge kill want feel emotion reason feel guilty thing done feel sad thing never happened miss people never knew crave loneliness hate alone tried get help helped still feel way never tried suicide habe people care care loosing grip sure know reason keep living know people love know chance whatever like want want enter door open others close stopped caring people deserve end want end also want keep going everyone around thing bit therapy changed removed big stone path way hole still fall hole constantly im waiting perfect moment snap nothing make sence anymore purpose survive day point come,dont know anymore,6629,19

I’ve reached the point at which I had promised myself was the point of no return…,"At this point I’m functioning on autopilot trying to tie up loose ends…but I’m hesitating still…I know the close future is going to be nothing but stress and anguish and a bunch of uncomfortable things I don’t want to experience…and overcoming it will leave me bitter…i fucked up so much in life that even if everything were to go my way from now until natural death, I will still feel pangs of regret and dread as it will not be enough to illicit any sense of well being.

I'm a terrible person.,"I lie a lot. It's usually nothing personal, it's just a defense mechanism and I'm often trying to convince myself as much as you.
I know I'm often hypocritical. I can't change anyway.
I struggle to empathize with others. I usually fail.
I'm currently scamming people for money because I'm too fucking impulsive for a normal job.

I don't know how I became this person but I don't like it. For a while I improved and had been on the right track, but I've gone downhill fast this year.

I'm having a hard time holding on,"I'm getting worse and worse. crying every day in silence while my family don't even know or care how bad I am. I rarely ever tell them anything anymore because they're so invalidating and uncaring. 

I'm trying to find reasons to hold on, even the little things but they're just becoming less and less. 

I've been thinking this week about if I could see into my future and see how things turned out, would I? At this point, I think I would and if it didn't work out (according to the rules of all of that ofc) I think I'd just end it. 

I've been struggling with so many mental and physical health problems since I was younger and things are only getting worse. 

Every morning, the second I wake up, I am flooded with pain and war in my head. I dread having woken up and count the hours 'til I can go to sleep and then I delay going to sleep because every night I have so many nightmares and wake up so much that even at night I can't find any moment of peace. It's an endless cycle of hell.

I can't walk around my house without having my earphones in and music up loud because that can lessen the volume of everything going on in my head. 

I am a disappointment. I am the elephant in the room. I can't get a job because of my health. 

The thought of living another day makes me feel sick and breakdown. 

Part of me just wants to end it. I've been cutting. But part of me also just wants my family to notice and actually care and help me. 

If I just kms then they wouldn't have that financial burden, they wouldn't be so annoyed or stressed, they could all just get on with their lives, they'd be so much happier. 

I think what's really keeping me going is my cat and the tiny thought of what if it does all work out? what if I have, do, everything I want and become who I want to be in an ideal/dream life. 

It's nice to have your head in the clouds for a bit, if not that then underground sounds better than the surface. 

It's funny because death is my biggest fear but it's something I want the most right now.

My final post...,"I've posted here a few times... I was always in a desperate and frantic state of mind when I made the posts. I don't know if I ever had the intention of acting but because of that I know I have to now. I'm going to spend time with my family, I always neglected them and even though I don't really want to hangout with them I know its the right thing to do. 

My mind is a hell and I am a terrible person. Maybe I'm only saying these things to gain sympathy or justify the wrong things I've done in my life. Maybe I do have OCD and i'm just being harsh on myself... I don't know anything about myself anymore. I am sure I am a monster and I don't want to walk this earth anymore. I feel like the phrase ""hurt people, hurt people"" really applies to me. Alot of people think I am sweet and caring, but maybe I'm just very manipulative. Because when someone doesn't return the favors I do, I bottle up anger and resentment. At least I think I do know, Its hard to remember who I was even six months ago. I look at everything in a new light now. People offer me help like work books and therapy, but I just wanna die... I don't wanna do all that work. I don't think I can be saved. I'm lazy and irresponsible. I've been like this my whole life. On top of that I'm a pathological liar... and I'm stupid. I can never figure things out on my own.

I did this thing when I was a kid, whenever I got in trouble I would have severe mental break downs. One time I remember I sat on the stairs saying ""I know my mom doesn't love me""... what kind of monster says that about their own mom? Especially a single mom that was trying their best to take care of me?

About 6 months ago is when all of this started, I met a girl online. We're in a ""relationship"" but I swear I look at people as objects. All I do is constantly tell this girl I love her and plan a future with her and I just never treat her like another normal human being. It's like I want to control how she feels, I want her to give everything to me just so I can feel secure in the relationship. On top of that I feel like I wear a mask, she doesn't even really know me. Shit, I don't even know me anymore.

But, I've really felt alone all my life. It's like I want close relationships but at the same time I don't because shit like this happens when people get too close. I can't tell if I'm evil or if I'm just self sabotaging my entire life. I'm worried I'm a sociopathic, narccisistic, asshole. 

I would rather die now than have my family see the true evil person I really am deep down. I'm ashamed of myself, although my family isn't very emotional or close they really do care about my well being. Some people don't even have that and I'm still where I am. Goes to show I'm truly just selfish. 

Also, I think terrible things that really make me question who I am. I once thought about rather having this girl I ""love"" die than be without her. What kind of thought is that???????? Shit, like that pops in my head and I just know I need to end myself before I hurt people in this world. I'm angry at the world, probably because It's too beautiful for someone like me to be in it. 

If you finished reading this, I appreciate your time. I hope you have a good life and I hope you find happiness in every way that you can. I'm nervous everything I'm saying is to gather sympathy or attention... maybe I'm even saying that to cover up the fact that I'm doing it? idk...

It's as if I'm not human, not one of them. Family means absolutely nothing to me. I crave love and security, yet aren't willing to truly care about someone.

It's not like I can either. I just feel like nobody truly cares about me and if they do - I don't care. I feel so distant from everyone, my body aching from the loneliness that has turned into physical pain.

I had a massive argument with two of my friends today.

So many people hate me (the people who bullied me) and now i get scared whenever i'm out. I have like 4 irl friends. I'm failing all my subjects at school. One of the family members never speaks to me, basically tells me to shut up when i speak and cares more about my brother than me. i lost all interest in everythings and lost contact with friends, my family are in so much debt and life is a mess. my grandad died a while ago and i miss him so much. no one checks up on me anymore, my friend was only nice to me because other people were around and on text he was a total dick. my ex also broke up with me but she wants me back and i cant deal with that. i had everything (other than being mentally stable) and i wanted to die. but now i have nothing, i should have been grateful. why shouldn't i give up? what am i even alive for?",throwawayreddit177,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/obwmzg/whats_the_point_anymore_tw/,vent post massive argument two friend today one told grow brain loveless one friend seems ignore whenever see dad abusive alcoholic family member tell always problem useless lazy ever done ruin people life many people hate people bullied get scared whenever like 4 irl friend failing subject school one family member never speaks basically tell shut speak care brother lost interest everythings lost contact friend family much debt life mess grandad died ago miss much one check anymore friend wa nice people around text wa total dick ex also broke want back cant deal everything mentally stable wanted die nothing grateful give even alive,point anymore tw,1182,28

as soon as i get freedom and autonomy i will use it to kill myself,"i start uni for the second time in september. last time i tried i came home after a single term and set a date to kill myself.

it didnt come to pass but after living at home doing nothing for now a year and a half and still being totally too depressed to do anything useful, i know im going to kill myself soon. i just ran out of weed for the forseeable future, my only helpful coping method and the only anti depressant to have ever helped. living at home, im known to be super introverted and basically hikikomori like, which has lead to me becoming more like that since i just get questioned and interrogated and controlled whenever i come out my room or leave the house. so, its difficult for me to summon the courage to leave to kill myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

so, if i dont attempt between now and uni im pretty certain i'll go jump off a building or in front of a train once i get to uni. im tired of all this feeling, im tired of being part of society, im tired of expectations, im tired of being supposed to have purpose, im tired of the fact that i was ever born. i never asked for this. i never asked to be put in an oppressive world that i have to work in, a world where i never feel happy, no matter what i do.",imgoingtokms4889,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/obxkh5/as_soon_as_i_get_freedom_and_autonomy_i_will_use/,start uni second time september last time tried came home single term set date kill didnt come pas living home nothing year half still totally depressed anything useful know im going kill soon ran weed forseeable future helpful coping method anti depressant ever helped living home im known super introverted basically hikikomori like ha lead becoming like since get questioned interrogated controlled whenever come room leave house difficult summon courage leave kill amp x200b dont attempt uni im pretty certain go jump building front train get uni im tired feeling im tired part society im tired expectation im tired supposed purpose im tired fact wa ever born never asked never asked put oppressive world work world never feel happy matter,soon get freedom autonomy use kill,1221,66

One last try,"15 failed medication trials. 2 bouts of ECT that didn't last. TMS failed. 

Finally found a medication that worked! Oh wait, it makes you terribly weak and shakey. Sometimes so much that you can't drive. Tried higher doses, gives me seizures. Lowest dose worked! Just weak and shakey. Now it doesn't work enough anymore. So I upped the dose because I had a day which made me realize I had to do something, and fast. I am now on anti-seizure meds for another condition, so hopefully that won't happen, but I'm so shakey, it is hard to clip my nails and sometimes write.

I have a psychiatrist appointment tomorrow. I can't do another med trial without long term hospitalization until we found one that works. ECT and TMS are out. Vagus nerve stimulation can take up to a year to work. Ketamine treatment (by a doctor) makes me uncomfortable (in the same way ECT did prior to experiencing) but I think it might be the only option.

I am going to give this one more try. If it fails, I'm done. Over. Just going to let it happen. This has been so difficult on my family and I can't do it to them anymore.

I can't live in this body any more.,"For as long as I can remember, I have struggled with gender dysphoria. I was born male, and have hated that. I see women who I wish I was but never will be. I have a broad chest and a hairy body. I have a wide jaw. I look nothing like a girl, and no amount of modern medicine, adjusted social standards, or surgery could fix that. I will never and could never be the woman I want to be. I want to believe in reincarnation, if only to believe I could die right now and be reborn as the girl I wish I was. 

No one knows how deep this goes. A few of my close friends know that I have struggled with gender dysphoria, but none of them know how bad it is. 

On top of this, I have absolutely fucked my own life into shambles. I have been cheated on, broken up with without a reason, and rejected by my peers. I was forced to drop out of college twice, laid off and tricked into a door to door sales job, and dragged to a different city by the roommates I hate and the girlfriend who is fucking my roommate and gaslighting me into thinking she isn't. 

I have nothing. No skill, no talent, no job, no money, and no good reason to keep living. There are people who would be upset if I died, but I can't keep on living like this. I can't keep living off of charity. I can't keep living in this mistake of a body. I can't keep doing this. 

I am alone tonight in the new apartment. I have a knife in the kitchen. I have never been presented with a better opportunity to end my own life in peace. 

I am going to use the last of my money on alcohol so I have the courage to finally end it. I have nothing but regret, and will continue to create regret as I go forward. I cannot change, so I will die instead.

Been suicidal for a while now but it’s gotten worse,"I’ve been suicidal since I was 14 (I’m 16 now) I pretty much think about it everyday. I just feel like my whole life is worthless and hopeless, I had a pretty shitty childhood my mum didn’t really care what I did and my dad died when I was 9. After that my mum was addicted to drugs so she could barely take care of me. I have a disabled brother so he’s basically the focus of everything I never get any attention from my mum. I don’t remember the last time she said she loves me or hugged her, I just wish I had someone who actually loved me. I’ve lost all of my friends because apparently I’m a dick but I don’t know how suppose I just try to push everyone away. I don’t know how I’m supposed to get anywhere with life I haven’t been to school since 14 too, my mum stopped me from going around the time I started having suicidal thoughts I guess that was the ignition of it. Now all she does is lay down all day and do nothing sometimes I have to go days without eating. I’m just so sick of this, everyone i tell never takes me seriously. I wish someone would help me I feel so hopeless and lost at this point it feels like suicide is the only option. My “best friend” he even says to me he thinks I’m never gonna have a job or succeed to anything in life so realistically what’s even the point in trying if the one person I trust even believes my worst fear.

Therapy ruined me,"I feel like im losing my mind. I've had problems my whole life. Things I've gone through, resulting in me developing some strange behaviour. I recently decided to go to therapy, I've been struggling with ""sad thoughts"", social anxiety and paranoia that have only gotten worse. The problem is that I then understood a lot more about myself. I only went once, the therapist then had to go on a 4 weeks vacation. I now know I struggle with derealization and depersonalization. This made my paranoia almost completely disappear. Those feelings have only gotten worse though. I don't even remember how long ago the meeting was, maybe a week or two? Since then I now question absolutely everything. I've always thought of myself ""as a character"". Like my life is a show. I can't find any actual meaning behind life, but I've never needed it. All life needed was the one experiencing it being immersed in their own life. I think I lost this since my therapy-session though. I had plans on streaming for example, along other ambitions or interests I've wanted to work on for a long time. I've dropped all plans on anything now though, and stopped caring about what other people, including my family, think of me. I go up and eat breakfast at 4:30 pm. My relationship with my gf feels so strange to me now. I still love her, I think. I don't know anymore though. How would I know? I don't think it's supposed to feel like this. I hate the thought of being around her, but I want to give her the whole world. I would sacrifice anything for her, but could I choose I would shut myself in and not meet with anyone. And even just writing this makes me second-guess myself though. I can't say that I actually feel this. But it feels so much, so real. It feels like it can't be though, I am complaining for nothing.   
I'm also sorry if this is a mess, I'm writing this while my mind is on fire. I don't know if I would do something drastic. I don't feel suicidal, but I can't actually find any reasons I had in the past for not doing something terrible. I don't want to. I really don't want to. But I could. I could spend 40 years behind a desk and always be so shut down about everything I enjoy as I am today. I'm so young, I should be excited about what the future holds. But I can't see myself in a future I like. I want to be where I am forever. Time just feels to slip out of my hands. And it's always felt like that, but before I could justify myself with how I atleast have enjoyed myself or done everything I could. Now I can't say the same anymore. What if ""not wasting my time"" would be doing something horrible? What says that that isn't the case? If nothing actually matters, what reason should ""getting better"" be the target? Can I? I never have. My life's been hard, but I've been positive the whole time. I know think that's because I just second-questioned myself. And still I know feel so much worse than I always have. So I can't find a way out. My gf always tells me that ""it *will* get better"", but that doesn't have to be true! Not everyone gets better. There are those who lose their minds. Who's to say that won't be me?   
So I'm scared. I can't talk to anyone about this. I can't even talk about all this with the therapist when she comes back either. It'll be the same old as always, I sit and smile and say what I think I should say. What makes me the most interesting as a character. I would be more interesting if I had struggles, right? Maybe that is why I have such an obsession with being sad. What if that goes further? What if I get violent, towards myself or anyone else I know?   
If I wanna go there, I've even had conversations with people that aren't there. I've heard this is normal, my brother have done the same for example. But that's the only other person I've heard about this, and it sounds an awful lot like other conditions I've heard about, like schizophrenia. That would be genetic. So it wouldn't be too far off.   
And I also change whatever I think all the time! I can feel like this one minute, than think I was being stupid or even ridiculous after. I live a normal life, nothing seems off.

Im just typing this at 1am very heartbroken so sorry if my writing is bad 
I have treatment resistant depression with very severe anhedonia I lost interest in everything I can't even enjoy food or anything at all, my sexual function is 0. My emotional numbness and apathy is through the roof. Essentially Im just a shell of human being just a dead robot. 

I'm losing everything, first depressive episode I lost my passion for maths and physics as I developped my first anhedonia this made me depressed for years and forced me into a college I hated so much for job security and were very depressed and suicidal for a long time until I met the love of my life then my second depressive episode hit and I lost all my romantic feelings became numb af unable to feel any love for her unable to feel anything at all this numbness also caused me to social withdraw and I cut contact with all my friends and this second depressive episode caused me to drop out of college now I dont know what to do. 

My passion and my love were the only things that mattered to me in this world and I lost them. Theres nothing left for me anymore theres nothing to fight for anymore I lost everything that mattered to me.

I cant keep on living like this known after each depressive episode Im gonna lose the most precious thing to me this is a hard life some of you may be able to endure it but for me I just cant. 

I have been trying everything literally everything to cure this condition but nothing is helping and it only gets worse with time I tried countless medications and lifestyle changes and nothing helped at all. And some meds actually worsened my symptoms permanently (I stopped the meds but the worsening effects didnt go away) I bought a box of amitriptyline for painless death I just don't know after how many trials I should commit suicide? For how long should I keep trying meds before deciding my condition is hopeless and suicide?

I don’t think there is anything more past this.,"My life hasn’t been the worst but has been a continuous stream of anguish.
I have plenty of hobbies and friends to distract myself from depression and I know how to push myself to be a better person. There are plenty to moments I can look back on and be proud of myself and I’m certain the future holds a lot in store for me good or bad. But over the last few years I have waken up to the reality that is the world. Fraud is around every corner, people are being taken advantage of to the tenth degree, our planet is actively dying before our eyes, the people today don’t make life worth living, I’m more then likely going to spend the rest of my life working a job I hate with little benefit to myself scraping away whatever amount of joy I can get while facing diminishing return after diminishing. I can’t keep living in this world that is clearly corrupted by the exponentially cancerous human race. I’ve lived with suicidal thoughts my entire life and after years and years of enduring life I don’t feel any better or worse, it’s just the same amount of me wanting kill myself with critical thinking entangled in it.

What I want to know is does anyone have answer for me that will make life worth living and it won’t subside the problems of this world, or do I just have the option of dealing with the punishment that is life or not.

I know how to make my life happy and feel accomplished, but everywhere I go I see and feel pain and misery and I’m just thinking what is the point the planet is going to die we are in a sinking ship and why should I stick around to check it out when I know I will hate the result.

How did you tell your kids about your self harm/past?,"I(f15) don’t have kids, I’ve always wanted kids and I plan to have some when I’m older and find the right partner. Life hasn’t been the kindest to me thus far and I have plenty of scars to prove it. My struggle with self harm has left my body very blatantly marked up. I’ve been through some things that are truly horrid, like rape, sexual/mental abuse, bullied, emotional abuse, gaslighting, manipulation. It’s been a lot. I know I can move past it all even though it’s just really hard right now.

My question to you, parents, is, how did you or do you plan to tell your children about these types of things? How do you explain self harm to a kid? How do you inform them so they don’t make the same mistakes that you did? When did you choose to tell them and if you chose not to, why so?

Note to husband,"I don’t want to feel happy again because it’s nothing to hold on to. I hold my breath at good news now. The truth is I was already traumatized before I met you. You were the first time I felt safe, myself, loved, and valued. The person you met was me at my highest. I was never that confident or sure of myself. I would’ve done anything you asked, and would’ve been anything you needed. I will no longer be on this earth for you to call when you need support. I’m sorry for that. Truly.

The only thing I ever wanted in life was to have a family that accepted and loved me. I wanted to create that with you. I am tired of loving and losing. Tired of this feeling. So sick to my stomach I can’t eat or take care of myself. My heart my mind my forgiveness. I am sorry, I gave my all and I don’t have it in me to build myself back up again. I’m exhausted spiritually emotionally and physically. The last two years have been torturous this is my weakest and humblest moment. Every day is more devastating than the last. Again I am so sorry. I’m not built for this, I just don’t have the capacity. No more fears, emotional pain, bad dreams, and lonely nights. I will be free.  I am content with my decision. I love you always.

Spiraling after getting friend zoned,I met this one girl at work recently and quickly developed feelings for her. We talked and texted each other all the time. I actually felt happy knowing that someone might actually care about me. I finally worked up the courage to ask her out today and she just tells me she’s gay but she still wants to be friends. While I’m glad we’re still friends the experience put me in a horrible mood and my family putting me down as always definitely didn’t help. While this whole experience wasn’t that bad the thoughts it lead me to have about previous attempts at relationships just makes me feel hopeless. Even her still being my friend bums me out because I know she’ll just ghost me randomly one day like everyone else. If nobody loves me then what’s the point in even going on?

I think I need to go to inpatient treatment but can’t,"Probably trigger warning for the obvious.
I think this is kind of a vent post. 

I’ve had suicidal thoughts before but usually in passing and i’m able to just ignore it and move on, and only once in a while. I am now thinking about hurting myself all day, I could be literally just holding a pen and be like “I should stab myself with this.” I am not going to do it, or kill myself, but I am not living. I am so exhausted of trying and waiting for things to get better. I just want to be free of these thoughts, I wish I didn’t have to fight to find my will to live. 

I’ve been thinking about checking myself into the psych ward for a while and the past couple days it’s all I can think about. I can’t see my life going any other way, because i’m not living and I can’t go on like this. I’m too afraid to check myself in though, i’m afraid because I know I don’t plan to kill myself that they won’t take me though. I don’t know what i’ll do if I can’t get help. 

I’m also so afraid to go because I’m a couple months into a new job, and I’ll be leaving all my coworkers in the lurch and it’ll be super understaffed. I know they’ll fire me because I said I would be there and that they could count on me. I work in my hometown too, so I’ll have to live five minutes away from people who are going to hate me.

I lost myself,"I’m a 22 year old female. I have a great family. I have a good paying job. I have my own car. These are things that people always mention to me when I tell them I’m struggling mentally. I’ve been diagnosed with major depression and anxiety recently but it’s probably been a problem I’ve had since I was 16 just never went to see a professional. Everything started falling apart when I met a person who I thought was going to be my forever. She was amazing, loving and unique. She was different from all of the people I’ve met and been with in the past. She made me feel whole. She brought me so much happiness to my sad life. I felt like I had finally found the light of my life. But then a couple months later she ended things at first because she wanted to find herself. Second reason because I was mentally weak and she needed someone strong minded. Third reason she gave which was recently was because she grew numb to everything, so she ended things because she didn’t want to hurt me. In the end she hurt me so much more. It’s been months and I still cry about her. I’m still in contact with her because we decided to remain as friends. I’m always there for her for when she goes through stuff without complaining because I just want her to be happy and feel like she’s not alone. She has such a strange way to show that she’s there for me. Early this week some people I used to call friends contacted me with a pic of a chick they “replaced” me with and along with a message telling me that I’m a replaceable person. That is topic I’m very sensitive about due to past stuff. I told her about it and she bluntly told me the truth. That they shouldn’t matter to me. They’re below me. That I need to stop letting it get to me and to stop crying about it. That I need to stop being so sensitive. My friends also feel like they’re slowly leaving. I’ve been feeling so alone for months. It’s become so painful to continue. This empty feeling in my chest is becoming so unbearable. Most days I just don’t know what to do. I go to work to distract myself. But once I’m home everything hits me all at once. I can’t tell my family anything or else they’ll cry and blame themselves for not doing better and in the end it makes me feel worse. I can’t tell friends because they’ll point out everything I have and that I shouldn’t be feeling so depressed and instead I should be happy. It’s becoming so unbearable for me. I started to self harm again. It’s the only way I found that I can release this pain for a while. But one thought always pops into my head and with each passing day it becomes more tempting.

I’ve thought about suicide for about 3 years now,"I’m 23 (M) and for about 3 years now, I’ve thought about ending my life. The thoughts come and go but it’s been consistent. This all stems from my inability to have a romantic relationship. I’ve never had a girlfriend before and every time I failed with trying to build relationships up whenever I was seeing a girl, it just made me feel worse and worse as a person basically to the point where I was berating myself daily and blaming myself for my shortcomings. Every time I see all my friends out with their significant others doing stuff together, I just get so depressed and want to stay in my room and cry all day. Every night in bed, I always imagine my girl and I going on dates, vacations, and doing fun activities and generally being happy together.  

I tried making the improvements I needed in order to finally maintain a relationship. I’ve worked on being more extroverted, I’ve worked on improving myself as a person with character and personality and just being more grateful with my life as I am very lucky for the life I’m living and knowing that it could be much worse. I love my friends, family and the accomplishments I’ve made in terms of being consistent with working out everyday and maintaining my good grades in college.

What to do now that I finally don't wanna die anymore? [age 23] (NEED ADVICE!),"So for the better part of two years I've been contemplating suicide. I've dreamed about ending my life. I've stood on a ledge and thought for a few minutes how easy it'd be to just jump. I've thought about standing in front of a train. Jumping in front of cars on a highway. Crashing in to cars with my moped. Jumping from my fifth floor balcony. And even the old classics like hanging yourself or using any weapon. I even thought of travelling from Europe to the US to jump off a skyskraper or maybe the Golden Gate Bridge.

&amp;#x200B;

For the last ten months I've also been committed to different psych wards. The first two months (since august 2020) I stayed in two closed facilities. The first they drugged me up so much that I was high on benzos for three weeks straight. Then they transferred me to a ward for junkies and addicts. Because I was so drugged up I wasn't even coherent. There they tried to label me with three different diagnosis. I also received the second punch to my face ever during my stay there. Some guy in his psychosis didn't like the way I was looking at him while he was tripping.

&amp;#x200B;

Then my life became a tad easier. They transferred me to a semi-open facility with people of my own age after 6 weeks. With the goal to stay there for a few more weeks and then move back home with my mom. But that's where my trouble really became serious. Because this was the second time in three years that I'd been committed my mom didn't want me back home. She did everything in her power to make sure I was unable to move back in with her and my younger sibblings.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story, lots of depression and suicide ideation later. I'm finally back home. I did everything I could to beat my mom, force her to take me back, and made sure I wasn't homeless overnight. But I also had to be patient for ten months because I know she wouldn't have taken me back even something like five weeks ago. There's a lot of tension at home and she makes it very clear that she doesn't like my pressence and the way I choose to live my life.

&amp;#x200B;

And partly I can understand where she's coming from. We've always clashed in certain ways. I'm her first child. My father has been absent for the past 20 years. I started doing drugs pretty late in my teens. I'm just the product of bad parenting, absence of love in my household and too much freedom. I've also been pretty naive before my twenties and people have abused that. Like, a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

Even now I still face bullying from time to time and people who remember who I was in the past (long story, different vibe). But I'm almost 24 and I just wanna move past my history with some people. And in many ways /i've already done so mentally. But in practice I still gotta grow a lot before I'll be satisfied with the person I'm becoming.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanna know. Does it actually stay better? Can it really be over, the constant urge to stop existing. Can I really accept the person I became and strive to achieve more than constant sadness and being overwhelmed by life. That's like the only thing I'm worried about. That the darkness I had inside never really went away.",Expert-Presence-7708,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/obyhy2/what_to_do_now_that_i_finally_dont_wanna_die/,better part two year contemplating suicide dreamed ending life stood ledge thought minute easy jump thought standing front train jumping front car highway crashing car moped jumping fifth floor balcony even old classic like hanging using weapon even thought travelling europe u jump skyskraper maybe golden gate bridge amp x200b last ten month also committed different psych ward first two month since august 2020 stayed two closed facility first drugged much wa high benzos three week straight transferred ward junky addict wa drugged even coherent tried label three different diagnosis also received second punch face ever stay guy psychosis like way wa looking wa tripping amp x200b life became tad easier transferred semi open facility people age 6 week goal stay week move back home mom trouble really became serious wa second time three year committed mom want back home everything power make sure wa unable move back younger sibblings amp x200b long story lot depression suicide ideation later finally back home everything could beat mom force take back made sure homeless overnight also patient ten month know taken back even something like five week ago lot tension home make clear like pressence way choose live life amp x200b partly understand coming always clashed certain way first child father ha absent past 20 year started drug pretty late teen product bad parenting absence love household much freedom also pretty naive twenty people abused like lot amp x200b even still face bullying time time people remember wa past long story different vibe almost 24 wanna move past history people many way already done mentally practice still gotta grow lot satisfied person becoming amp x200b wanna know doe actually stay better really constant urge stop existing really accept person became strive achieve constant sadness overwhelmed life like thing worried darkness inside never really went away,finally wanna die anymore age 23 need advice,3175,78

"Rollercoaster of moods, today I am back to the dark isolated room stuck with intrusive thoughts, fantasizing about wanting to end my life. This one song has been on repeat because it reminds me of when I was a happy, highly motivated person who everyone loved to be around.","I have been watching TiK ToKs and this song has been trending with a dance.  I realized today that the chorus of this song actually reminds me before all of this began, it’s like me asking myself if I ever remember being a completely different person - before I lost my father, before I lost my job due to my mental illness, before I wished to never wake up again after going to bed.  

The song is “Heartbreak Anniversary” by Giveon.  Below are lyrics I am referring to.  


“Just like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever
Said that you love me, but that'll last for never
It's cold outside like when you walked out my life
Why you walk out my life?

[Chorus]
I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary, do you ever think of me?” 

Although the lyrics are about someone and a relationship, to me, it’s me asking my past self about those days before I was diagnosed with bipolar depression, the days I used to love myself and be proud of what I had become.  Do you ever think of me? 

I know this isn’t exactly a suicide note, but I posted here because I fantasize about my death every night.

Too scared to live but too scared to die,"I’ve never been a fan of the final yeet because I know I’m incompetent and would mess that up and probably leave myself in an astronomically worse position than before. I still want to, though. I think I’ve found a new way to go that won’t be guaranteed suffering.


It’s 5pm. I’m still lying in bed in a dark room because I’m scared that I’ll do something if I let myself move. I can’t sleep because the most emotionally damaging kind of thing for me has occurred, and all I do is have panic attacks and spiral. I can’t eat because I won’t keep it down. I can’t shower because I’m so tempted to just bleed out in it.


No one is keeping me here. People can say they care, but it doesn’t matter to me. I’m nothing special to anyone, and it will be a pain they can get over without a doubt. He keeps saying that he cares so deeply about me, but he did this to me. This isn’t something that I can ever be able to come to terms with, and the only thing that would make me feel better would be the peace that would come with knowing that it’s on his conscience. Of course, this is only a bonus to ending my pain and the intrusive thoughts and the never-ending sick feeling. I was already suffering every day, but now I’m irreparably destroyed. I know I can have a bright future, but does it matter if it’s filled with constant severe emotional pain?


I want to go to the emergency room because maybe I could be helped, but I don’t know if it’s worth it. The wait times are so long, and I’m not even sure that they won’t just take my blood pressure and send me home with some pamphlets. I don’t think I need anyone to talk to — I’m very logical (I think) and have always been able to reason my way out of this. It’s just that, at this point, it’s very clear that it will be a very hard life being this emotionally unstable, and any progress would take lots of hard work and perseverance. I’m not sure if I have it in me, and I don’t want to try in case it puts me in an even worse place.

Disconnection,"I forgot to tell my therapist about this so I'm putting it here.

This is a dumb post but I want to die so hopefully that's good enough.

I was rewatching some of Jenna Marbles old videos when I came across the video of her taking her dogs (Bunny and Kermit specifically) to the beach with Julien.

As I was watching Jenna walk her two dogs along the beach and watching her and Julien sit in their wind tent and eat sandwiches, I'd never felt such a huge disconnection from myself and another person before.

I just, cannot ever picture myself in a position where I'm with another person that I love and just... Being completely content like that.

They just seemed so happy to simply be in each other's company with their dogs.

Fuck nothing like that will ever happen to me.

I don't think I'll ever have a moment like that, a moment that just makes you feel so utterly at peace with yourself and the world around you.

Destroying myself because it’s too hard to go on,"I have been through a lot and people say it makes me strong. Yet I hate it, I refuse to wear it as a badge of honour. I don’t want a difficult life, I rather have an easy one. This year I have tried to let things go and start fresh. Some days I feel okay and “empowered”. Other days, like today, I can’t take it. The past and my current situation make me feel so small and powerless. 

I am so addicted to inactivity. I went from an abused and bright child to being a brainless lazy piece of shit. All I do all day besides cleaning my room and cooking, is browsing Reddit and watching YouTube videos. I rarely comment, I just consume content. It took me months to change and now I’m back to the same behaviour. The sad thing is that I studied disorders and know what’s affecting me. Therefore, the two psychologists see me as someone who can cope with it. In the sessions, I feel like I don’t have it that bad so I just accept the advice they give me and try to implement it. Yet, after a week at most I get back to that place of hating myself again. 

I know how to find ways to torture myself without it going too far. I pluck body hair, but make sure not to touch any areas on my face or head. I binge on food, but make sure not to purge and do some fasts instead. Yet, my thoughts are so depressing and ugly it feels like there are invisible knives in it. I have come at a point that I think maybe I should cut myself, maybe I should get into debt, maybe I should become an alcoholic, maybe I should start using drugs. Only then will they take me serious. I even told the psychologist I was thinking of killing myself and she asked if I had taken steps towards it. I said I had not, but have a strong urge to jump off a bridge or jump in front of the train…. And I seem normal enough when talking and not crying so maybe she doesn’t see it as urgent. It’s really frustrating me. 

The reason why I talk normally is, because of the pandemic I have digital sessions. And I have roommates who seem to already judge me for not working, so I don’t want them to hear me crying. I also can’t talk freely at home. I wish I could live by myself, but I don’t have the funds for it. And I can’t get myself to apply for a job, and the few times I did I got rejected…

One of my parents left the whole continent, and the other one I only have contact with since a few months. My mom accused my dad of being a pedophile so I’m wary of being in contact with him. My mom left to a wartorn country, so I can’t visit her even. Both of them are not there for me and hurt me a lot in the past. I tried to forgive them, but they always disappoint me. When I call they don’t pick up the call, and when they rarely call me is because they need something. 

I can’t even be with my long distance boyfriend, because I don’t work and can’t help him with visa. And he’s busy finishing his thesis and we have 12 hours distance between us. He supports me so much emotionally. Instead of supporting him back I lash out at him and pressure him to look for a job in my country. Today, I kept arguing to him and hurt him again with my words. 

To be honest, I just want to give up. This summer I want to visit Disneyland for the first time in my life and after just end it all. The only thing that brought me happiness as a kid besides food, and videogames was Disney movies. Now food became a crutch and I don’t remember the last time I enjoyed playing a game. Hopefully I can have my last happy day before I die.

Writing this took me so much energy, I took several breaks and went from crying to just being numb and feeling nothing. I wanted to delete it all and not post.

I’m not sure anyone will read this. Atleast I left a trace behind on Reddit…",SATMoonBaby,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/obph4s/destroying_myself_because_its_too_hard_to_go_on/,lot people say make strong yet hate refuse wear badge honour want difficult life rather easy one year tried let thing go start fresh day feel okay empowered day like today take past current situation make feel small powerless addicted inactivity went abused bright child brainless lazy piece shit day besides cleaning room cooking browsing reddit watching youtube video rarely comment consume content took month change back behaviour sad thing studied disorder know affecting therefore two psychologist see someone cope session feel like bad accept advice give try implement yet week get back place hating know find way torture without going far pluck body hair make sure touch area face head binge food make sure purge fast instead yet thought depressing ugly feel like invisible knife come point think maybe cut maybe get debt maybe become alcoholic maybe start using drug take serious even told psychologist wa thinking killing asked taken step towards said strong urge jump bridge jump front train seem normal enough talking cry maybe see urgent really frustrating reason talk normally pandemic digital session roommate seem already judge working want hear cry also talk freely home wish could live fund get apply job time got rejected one parent left whole continent one contact since month mom accused dad pedophile wary contact mom left wartorn country visit even hurt lot past tried forgive always disappoint call pick call rarely call need something even long distance boyfriend work help visa busy finishing thesis 12 hour distance u support much emotionally instead supporting back lash pressure look job country today kept arguing hurt word honest want give summer want visit disneyland first time life end thing brought happiness kid besides food videogames wa disney movie food became crutch remember last time enjoyed playing game hopefully last happy day die writing took much energy took several break went cry numb feeling nothing wanted delete post sure anyone read atleast left trace behind reddit,destroying hard go,3724,48
very heavy mental health day.,"it is July now, and anytime I am reminded that time is passing and I am just here is really unsettling. I am currently preparing for a day, specifically the 4th, that I will be left alone with only myself for company. everyone else will be out or just spending time with other friends and family.

so how am I spending today and probably the next few days? in utter terror, crying my eyes out because I don’t want to feel this way anymore. I don’t want to “prepare” for these lonely days, you know? I want to be okay in my own company. it feels impossible right now, though. I’ve just been crying nonstop today and once again mentally planning out my exit. I will be able to purchase sn tomorrow. that is what terrifies me a lot* - having the means to carry everything out, leaving this brutally painful life.

I will be okay in the meantime despite everything, I will. I’ll get myself together now. I am still cheering us on.

Got scammed lost a lot of money now death doesn't sound that bad compared to this gut feeling,"I have taken money from a lot of friends and such, but now that I lost everything I cannot even look to they're faces, just the thought of telling them that I fucked up is hard enough, I'm just 18, being pretty pussy for thinking about suicide due to somethings as stupid as pride, but I can't live with this felling in my hearth, i don't know how to explain, but I can't even sleep is like a pressure in my chest, my girlfriend helps all a lot this coldness fix quite a bit with her, but it keeps growing, and the debts that I own they will just keep growing as well, one of the friends that help me get some money had to order a loan to help me, I feel like I betrayed him, not just him, everybody, i just want this pain in my chest to stop, i don't know what exactly is but is cold and it doesn't let me even sleep or eat, has been 2 days since I got scammed, and still the pressure doesn't flitch it just grows, suicide would be painful, I'm a selfish fucker, i do think dying would make some people sad but whatever, if I feel sad, i will be dead anyways, since, well I will just disappear when I die what pain would I cause would mean nothing to me, after all the dead doesn't have emotions.

I understand if you think this is a foolish reason to commit suicide but thats the only escape method that I found, and to be honest my life hasn't been the best so yeah kinda finish it with a blast.

I'm still chosing a suicide method but sounds like gas explosion would be the ""painless"" option, cars don't CO2 poison you and I don't have access to guns, so gas shall be.

I'm writing this as a reminder, for anyone to read that I at least existed, or for me if I don't kill myself tomorrow, that this was the worst phase of my life and in the future I will read this and find it cringe and such

Edit: im not the person with the worst past but I got raped and drugged when I was 15 with my cousin, i don't think this helps a lot, in this possible suicide of mine, since this memory is kinda blocked in my mind, but at any case it feel good to say this to anyone, kinda at ease

A life that I don’t have control over isn’t a life worth living,"I’m tired. I’m desperately tired of the same routine to just survive. I can’t fathom that I’m supposed to give my energy, my time- my natural born right, to work for someone else.

I don’t get to learn who I am, I don’t get to explore my interests. I don’t get to grow. To just focus on growing. 

I need to heal man. I need time to learn myself, to take care of myself, to create myself. To unlearn all I’ve been taught about who I am and who I should be. 

The responsibilities I picked up weren’t the ones I chose, but the ones I have was expected to carry. 

I just hope I have enough in me to create a life I want to live. Because there’s only so many days of surviving I can take before I want to end it all.

I wish life wasn’t so painful. I wish I was at peace with the default- so many around me are cool with working jobs they hate cuz they pick up happiness from friends or drinking and I’m just not like that. I have so many things I want to create. My self value comes from my ability to turn my ideas into reality, to own my time, to be free in my decision making.

My family is the one to blame for my horrible life. (FINAL POST MAYBE.),"I detest every single relative I have.

Help,"I am depressed and I do not know how to help myself. I feel like everything around me is falling apart. Some of it is my fault, and some of it is something that I cannot control. I will be listing what I think the causes are. I am sorry if my construction of this post is hard to read; I am not very good with english.

I have a chronic illness that makes my everyday life hard. Everything that I love doing or anything that I want to improve on is near impossible to achieve because my illness. I work hard when I want something, but it's really frustrating that my illness keeps holding me back. I go through a lot of pain and treatment is very hard and expensive. Everytime I have a relapse, I have to go onto a liquid diet for three months. Same drink everyday. Same taste in my mouth for three months. There are some easier treatments, but I cannot afford it. 

My relationship with my family is not that great. Ever since I was a child my parents would always fight almost every month. The fights lasted days or a week. Due to that I have been always anxious when I hear a loud sound or people screaming, even when I am out of the house. My heart would start beating fast and eventually my hands would not stop shaking. They split up when I was sixteen and had divorce a 3 years late, which was last year.  Even though my parents provided me food, shelter, money, and healthcare, I feel no affection for them. My father rarely talks to me and my mother mostly thinks about her work. I tried to open up with many times, but they seem to care very little and does nothing to improve my views of them or my relationship to them.

My grandma, who I love very much, died last year due to covid. She lives in another country and rarely had the chance to visit her. We video call every other day to keep in touch with each other. Unfortunately, due to her old age and some other complications her body can't keep up with the treatment. It really sucks that I wasn't able to attend her funeral and talk to her when she got admitted to the hospital. 

I also lost my best friend to an accident last January. We've known each other since elementary school. We went to the same highschool and university. We even chose the same course to study. It happened so fast.

I became anxious talking to people that eventually I shut myself from my other friends and rarely talk to them. I do not know the reason why I get anxious now. Last year I can still talk to people normally.

It feels unreal that these things happen to me one after the other. I do not know what to deal with first and how to cope with it. I think of commiting suicide everyday. Fortunately, my s/o keeps from doing it. Just thinking how it would affect her someone she loves commit suicide breaks my heart. 

I want to go to a therapist or a psychiatrist to help myself, but I cannot afford it.",HAMENEGG,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/obv4ml/help/,depressed know help feel like everything around falling apart fault something cannot control listing think cause sorry construction post hard read good english chronic illness make everyday life hard everything love anything want improve near impossible achieve illness work hard want something really frustrating illness keep holding back go lot pain treatment hard expensive everytime relapse go onto liquid diet three month drink everyday taste mouth three month easier treatment cannot afford relationship family great ever since wa child parent would always fight almost every month fight lasted day week due always anxious hear loud sound people screaming even house heart would start beating fast eventually hand would stop shaking split wa sixteen divorce 3 year late wa last year even though parent provided food shelter money healthcare feel affection father rarely talk mother mostly think work tried open many time seem care little doe nothing improve view relationship grandma love much died last year due covid life another country rarely chance visit video call every day keep touch unfortunately due old age complication body keep treatment really suck able attend funeral talk got admitted hospital also lost best friend accident last january known since elementary school went highschool university even chose course study happened fast became anxious talking people eventually shut friend rarely talk know reason get anxious last year still talk people normally feel unreal thing happen one know deal first cope think commiting suicide everyday fortunately keep thinking would affect someone love commit suicide break heart want go therapist psychiatrist help cannot afford,help,2856,4

I can’t wait for the day that I lose,"Every day for the last 9 years I felt like I’ve woken up not knowing if today was the day I’d finally end my pain. It goes beyond 9 years as I’ve always dealt with terrible thoughts as a child. When I was 15 and my mothers was being abusive I snapped and decided to end my life. I ran away, called my mom on a pay phone, said my last words and then headed to the railway tracks. I was inches away from it being over, but I decided that I’d stay and try to make a difference with my life. 

I have never felt loved in my life. The people who said they loved me are the same ones that would hit me, make me feel horrible with words and neglect me. It’s not like I’ve never had the opportunity to have a relationship, I’ve actually had several. It feels as though getting into one knowing I will take my own life one day would be inconsiderate to the partner so I’ve turned those people away each time. Every day I feel this unbelievable pain inside of me, this part of me that just wants to have that feeling of falling knowing that someone is there to catch you. The safety of being yourself and knowing you will be loved. This feeling shakes me at my very core and I need to think “you will never be loved and that’s okay” just to survive. 

Here I am 9 years later having tried weekly therapy for 6 of those. Playing medication roulette and learning techniques like grounding that can apparently undo years of suffering. Nothing has worked. I’m even on a wait list for Electroconvulsive therapy. My mental health diagnoses can’t be counted on 2 hands. 

And yet I do feel some freedom. I’m progressing more without therapy accepting my own death than I am trying to fight it. I’m finally on track to my goal of getting a PhD and hopefully making some contribution to making the world better. I had a 4.0 GPA last semester and it has been getting easier. It’s a goal I am hell bent on so I can finally earn my death and be free from this pain. I find a certain solace in being unsavable and every time I’m successful I feel validated in my own decision. I feel like pushing through all this pain and making a difference, even if that means only publishing a couple molecular biology papers, gives me the right to take my life. This is the vehicle I’ve chosen to try to make the world better and it’s the vehicle that will let me feel the peace of closing my eyes and knowing that I never need to open them again.",BigManBootyhole,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/obmbgx/i_cant_wait_for_the_day_that_i_lose/,every day last 9 year felt like woken knowing today wa day finally end pain go beyond 9 year always dealt terrible thought child wa 15 mother wa abusive snapped decided end life ran away called mom pay phone said last word headed railway track wa inch away decided stay try make difference life never felt loved life people said loved one would hit make feel horrible word neglect like never opportunity relationship actually several feel though getting one knowing take life one day would inconsiderate partner turned people away time every day feel unbelievable pain inside part want feeling falling knowing someone catch safety knowing loved feeling shake core need think never loved okay survive 9 year later tried weekly therapy 6 playing medication roulette learning technique like grounding apparently undo year suffering nothing ha worked even wait list electroconvulsive therapy mental health diagnosis counted 2 hand yet feel freedom progressing without therapy accepting death trying fight finally track goal getting phd hopefully making contribution making world better 4 0 gpa last semester ha getting easier goal hell bent finally earn death free pain find certain solace unsavable every time successful feel validated decision feel like pushing pain making difference even mean publishing couple molecular biology paper give right take life vehicle chosen try make world better vehicle let feel peace closing eye knowing never need open,wait day lose,2412,36

I can't handle my borderline personality anymore,"I don't want to live like this. The pain is so overwhelming and never stops. I've tried to get help. Therapy and medication. I read dbt books.

It's just fucked and im fed up. When I was a kid all I wanted was to feel loved and heard and now because of that I'm cursed with a disorder that makes it practically impossible to feel loved. On top of that it makes just about everyone I've ever loved resent me with all my crying and breaking down, constant need for reassurance, splitting. I don't want to live knowing anyone I ever love will never feel the same way about me.
